Based on discussions and reviews of the movie, the "popcorn eyes" gag in KPop Demon Hunter appears to be an original concept created for the film. It's used as a visual metaphor to represent the characters' extreme blushing and excitement, so intense that their eyes (which are first depicted as corn kernels) get "heated up" and pop into popcorn.
The gag is a key part of the movie's unique animated style and visual language, which uses exaggerated, over-the-top gags to convey character emotions.
