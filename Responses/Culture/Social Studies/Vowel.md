In linguistics, a vowel is fundamentally defined as a speech sound produced without any significant obstruction or stricture in the vocal tract. This means that when you make a vowel sound, air flows relatively freely from your lungs, through your mouth, without being blocked by your tongue, lips, or throat.
Here's a breakdown of what defines a vowel:
 * Open Vocal Tract: The most crucial characteristic. Unlike consonants, which involve some form of constriction or closure (like your lips coming together for "b" or "p," or your tongue touching the roof of your mouth for "t" or "d"), vowels are produced with an open, unobstructed vocal tract.
 * Voiced: Vowels are typically voiced, meaning your vocal cords vibrate when you produce them. While it's possible to whisper vowels (making them unvoiced), their natural production involves vocal cord vibration.
 * Syllabic Nucleus: Vowels form the core, or "nucleus," of a syllable. Every syllable in a spoken language typically contains at least one vowel sound. Consonants, on the other hand, usually form the onset or coda (beginning or end) of a syllable.
 * Produced by Tongue and Lip Position: While there's no obstruction, the specific quality of a vowel sound is determined by the position of your tongue (height and front-to-back position) and the shape of your lips (rounded or unrounded). Linguists use these factors to classify different vowel sounds.
It's important to note the distinction between vowel sounds (phonetic definition) and vowel letters (orthographic definition). In English, the letters A, E, I, O, U are commonly referred to as vowels, and sometimes Y and W can also represent vowel sounds. However, the number of actual vowel sounds in English is greater than the number of vowel letters. For example, the "a" in "cat" sounds different from the "a" in "father."
