Jinu's backstory in KPop Demon Hunters reveals that he was once a human living in extreme poverty about 400 years ago. Desperate to escape his circumstances, he made a deal with the demon Gwi-Ma. In exchange for a beautiful voice that brought him fame and wealth, Gwi-Ma condemned him to the demon world.
This deal had a tragic consequence: while Jinu rose in status, his family was not included in the bargain. They were cast out, and Jinu was left with deep guilt and shame over their downfall. He is haunted by the memory of failing his family, a pain that Gwi-Ma uses to manipulate him. Jinu's motivation to have his memories erased is to escape this unbearable regret and self-loathing.
