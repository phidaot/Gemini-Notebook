Honmoon is a central element in the plot of the animated musical film *KPop Demon Hunters*. It is a magical, protective barrier that seals demons away from the human world.

Here's how it works in the movie's lore:

* **The Seal:** The Honmoon was created centuries ago by the first demon hunters. Its purpose is to act as a shield to keep demons from entering the human realm and preying on human souls.
* **Powered by Music:** The barrier is maintained and strengthened by the voices and songs of a new generation of demon hunters. These hunters are typically a trio of K-pop idols. The power of their music, and the way it brings people together, directly contributes to the strength of the Honmoon.
* **The "Golden Honmoon":** The ultimate goal of the demon hunters is to strengthen the barrier to its maximum potential, at which point it would become the "Golden Honmoon." This would be an impenetrable, permanent seal that would banish all demons from the human world forever.
* **Vulnerability:** The Honmoon can be weakened if the K-pop group's popularity declines or if their fans are swayed by rival groups, particularly those with demonic ties. This is a major plot point in the movie, where the rival boy band, the Saja Boys, are secretly demons who try to weaken the Honmoon by stealing fans.
* **The "New Honmoon":** Without giving away too many spoilers, the film introduces a new, more nuanced version of the Honmoon that reflects the protagonist's journey of self-acceptance and rejection of traditional, rigid ideas of good versus evil.

Given your interest in games like *Final Fantasy* and *Majora's Mask*, which often feature magical seals, rituals, and the idea of time loops, the concept of the Honmoon might be quite compelling. It's a magical barrier with a direct and measurable impact on the world, much like the spells or world-saving rituals you've seen in those games.
