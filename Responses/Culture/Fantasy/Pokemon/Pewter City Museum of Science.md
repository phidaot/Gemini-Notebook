You're right, in Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, there is a 50 Poké Dollar fee to enter the Pewter City Museum of Science.
Here's why you might choose to pay it:
 * Lore and Aesthetics: The museum offers some interesting exhibits and flavor text that add to the world-building of Kanto. If you enjoy immersing yourself in the game's setting and learning about the world of Pokémon, it's a small price to pay.
 * Old Amber (Later in the Game): The main reason to visit the museum, and specifically to pay the 50 Poké Dollar fee, comes much later in the game. After you obtain the "Chop Down" Secret Technique (which you get after defeating Erika, the Celadon City Gym Leader), you can access a hidden area in the back of the museum. There, you'll find a scientist who will give you the Old Amber, which can be revived into an Aerodactyl at the Cinnabar Island Lab. This is the only way to get Aerodactyl in the game.
So, is it worth it early on?
No, not really. Early in the game, there's not much you can do inside the museum other than look at the exhibits. You won't be able to get the Old Amber until much later. You can save your 50 Poké Dollars for Poké Balls or Potions in the early game.
Is it worth it later in the game?
Absolutely, if you want an Aerodactyl! The Old Amber is a valuable item for completing your Pokédex and adding a powerful Flying/Rock-type Pokémon to your team.
