Eevee is a unique Pokémon in Pokémon Go because it can evolve into eight different forms, each with a different type. Here are the different ways to evolve Eevee:
1. The "Nickname Trick" (One-Time Use Per Evolution)
This is the easiest way to guarantee a specific Eeveelution, but it only works once for each evolution. Simply rename your Eevee to the corresponding nickname before evolving it with 25 Eevee Candies.
 * Vaporeon (Water): Rename to Rainer
 * Jolteon (Electric): Rename to Sparky
 * Flareon (Fire): Rename to Pyro
 * Espeon (Psychic): Rename to Sakura
 * Umbreon (Dark): Rename to Tamao
 * Leafeon (Grass): Rename to Linnea
 * Glaceon (Ice): Rename to Rea
 * Sylveon (Fairy): Rename to Kira
Important Note: After using the nickname trick once for a specific evolution, you'll need to use the alternative methods for subsequent evolutions of that type. Always double-check the silhouette on the evolve button to ensure it shows the correct Eeveelution before you confirm.
2. Standard Evolution Methods (After using the Nickname Trick)
 * Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon: If you evolve Eevee with 25 Eevee Candies without using a specific trick, it will randomly evolve into one of these three.
 * Espeon (Psychic):
   * Make Eevee your Buddy Pokémon.
   * Walk 10 km with Eevee as your buddy and earn at least 2 Eevee Candies.
   * Evolve Eevee during the day while it is still your buddy.
   * During the July 2025 Community Day Classic event (which is currently happening until July 12), the walking requirement is reduced to just 1km!
 * Umbreon (Dark):
   * Make Eevee your Buddy Pokémon.
   * Walk 10 km with Eevee as your buddy and earn at least 2 Eevee Candies.
   * Evolve Eevee during the night while it is still your buddy.
   * During the July 2025 Community Day Classic event, the walking requirement is reduced to just 1km!
 * Leafeon (Grass):
   * Evolve Eevee while you are within range of a PokéStop with an active Mossy Lure Module applied.
 * Glaceon (Ice):
   * Evolve Eevee while you are within range of a PokéStop with an active Glacial Lure Module applied.
 * Sylveon (Fairy):
   * Make Eevee your Buddy Pokémon.
   * Earn 70 Buddy Hearts with Eevee. This means getting it to at least "Great Buddy" level.
   * Evolve Eevee with 25 Eevee Candies while it is still your buddy.
   * During the July 2025 Community Day Classic event, the heart requirement is reduced to just 7 hearts!
Tips for Evolving Eevee:
 * Eevee Candies: You'll need 25 Eevee Candies for each evolution. Catching Eevees and using Pinap Berries will help you gather candies faster.
 * Community Day Classic (July 2025): As it's currently July, the Eevee Community Day Classic is active. This event makes it significantly easier to get Espeon, Umbreon, and Sylveon due to reduced requirements. Also, any Eevee evolved during this event (before July 12, 10 PM local time) will know a special featured attack!
Good luck getting all your Eeveelutions!
