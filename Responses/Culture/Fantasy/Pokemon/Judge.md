It's much easier to check IVs directly in **Pokemon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Eevee!** once you've unlocked the "Judge" function. You don't need to send them to Pokemon Home first.

Here's how to quickly check IVs in Let's Go:

1.  **Unlock the Judge Function:** You'll need to catch at least **30 unique species of Pokémon** in your Pokédex. Once you've done that, head to the building on **Route 11**, which is to the east (right) of Vermilion City. Go upstairs and talk to Professor Oak's aide. He will add the Judge function to your Pokédex.
2.  **Check a Pokémon's Summary:** After unlocking the Judge function, go to your party or your Pokémon Box. Select the Pokémon you want to check, then choose "Check summary."
3.  **Use the Judge Function:** While on the Pokémon's summary screen, press the **Y button** (or shake your Joy-Con/Poké Ball Plus). This will display the IVs for each stat using descriptive terms like "Best," "Fantastic," "Very Good," "Pretty Good," "Decent," and "No Good."

These terms correspond to specific IV ranges:
* **Best:** 31 IVs
* **Fantastic:** 30 IVs
* **Very Good:** 26-29 IVs
* **Pretty Good:** 16-25 IVs
* **Decent:** 1-15 IVs
* **No Good:** 0 IVs

Using the in-game Judge function is the quickest and most direct way to assess your Pokémon's IVs in Let's Go.
