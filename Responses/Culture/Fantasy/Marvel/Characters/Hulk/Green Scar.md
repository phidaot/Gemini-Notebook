Green Scar, also known as the "Worldbreaker," is one of the most powerful and well-known incarnations of the Hulk. This persona emerged during the "Planet Hulk" and "World War Hulk" comic book storylines.

Here's a breakdown of what makes Green Scar significant:

* **Origin:** The Green Scar persona was born out of tragedy. After being exiled from Earth by the Illuminati, a group of powerful heroes, the Hulk was sent to a gladiator planet called Sakaar. There, he was forced to fight for his survival, and over time, he developed into a more cunning and strategic version of the Hulk. He was no longer just a rampaging brute; he was a leader, a gladiator, and eventually, a king. The scars he received during his time on Sakaar led to the name "Green Scar."

* **Intelligence and Personality:** Unlike the classic, more child-like "Savage Hulk" persona, Green Scar has the intelligence of Bruce Banner combined with the ferocity of the Hulk. He's able to think strategically, use weapons, and communicate effectively, which makes him a more formidable opponent. However, his core remains incredibly angry, especially after the devastating events that conclude his time on Sakaar.

* **Power:** Green Scar is considered one of the strongest versions of the Hulk. His rage, a key factor in the Hulk's strength, was magnified by the grief and betrayal he experienced, pushing his power to a level never seen before. He is capable of feats that earned him the title "Worldbreaker." This power level is so immense that in some stories, it's considered almost impossible to stop him.

* **"World War Hulk" Event:** The Green Scar persona is at the center of the "World War Hulk" storyline, where he returns to Earth seeking revenge on the Illuminati for what they did to him. This event showcases his immense power and tactical mind as he takes on the entire Marvel hero community.
