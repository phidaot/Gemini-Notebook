"World War Hulk" is a major Marvel Comics crossover storyline from 2007. It's a sequel to the "Planet Hulk" storyline and focuses on the Hulk's return to Earth seeking vengeance.

Here's a breakdown of the story:

* **The Setup:** In the "Planet Hulk" story, a secret group of heroes called the Illuminati (consisting of Iron Man, Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, and Mister Fantastic) decided that the Hulk was too dangerous for Earth and tricked him into a spaceship, intending to send him to a peaceful planet. However, the ship was thrown off course and crash-landed on the planet Sakaar, where the Hulk was enslaved and forced to fight as a gladiator. He eventually became the planet's king, found peace, and even a pregnant wife.
* **The Inciting Incident:** Tragedy struck when the spaceship that brought the Hulk to Sakaar exploded, killing thousands of people, including his wife. Blaming the Illuminati for her death, a more powerful and enraged Hulk—now known as the "World Breaker"—returns to Earth with his allies, the Warbound, to get his revenge.
* **The Conflict:** The Hulk and the Warbound land in Manhattan and begin their rampage. The Hulk systematically takes on and defeats many of Marvel's most powerful heroes and teams, including Iron Man, the Fantastic Four, and various Avengers teams. He puts the defeated heroes in a gladiatorial arena in Madison Square Garden, forcing them to fight as he was on Sakaar.
* **The Climax:** The conflict culminates in a massive battle between the Hulk and the Sentry, one of the most powerful heroes on Earth. The fight is so devastating that it threatens to destroy the entire city.
* **The Resolution:** During the fight, a member of the Hulk's Warbound reveals that the Illuminati were not responsible for the ship's explosion—it was his doing. He wanted to keep the Hulk's rage alive. This revelation enrages the Hulk further, causing his power to spiral out of control and threaten the planet itself. Ultimately, the Hulk is defeated and reverted to his Bruce Banner form, and he and the Warbound are imprisoned.
