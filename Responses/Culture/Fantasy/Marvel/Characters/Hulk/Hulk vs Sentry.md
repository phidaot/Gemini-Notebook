The battle between the Hulk and Sentry is a legendary one in the comics, particularly the one in the *World War Hulk* storyline. It's often cited as one of the most epic one-on-one fights in Marvel history.

Here's a breakdown of the key factors:

* **World War Hulk:** In this comic event, Hulk returns to Earth after being exiled and is at his most powerful and enraged state, known as "Green Scar." He's stronger than he has ever been before.
* **The Sentry's Power:** The Sentry is often described as having "the power of a million exploding suns." He is immensely powerful, but his abilities are also tied to his mental state. The Sentry struggles with his own dark alter ego, the Void, and his own agoraphobia and instability can hinder him.
* **The Fight:** The fight between these two was a cataclysmic slugfest that leveled a city. It was a pure physical brawl between two of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe. The fight was so intense that the energy they were expending was threatening to destroy the planet.
* **The Outcome:** The battle didn't have a clear winner in the traditional sense. It ended with both characters reverting back to their human forms, Bruce Banner and Robert Reynolds. Bruce, still fueled by rage and adrenaline, was able to knock out the unstable and exhausted Robert. However, it's also worth noting that this version of Sentry was mentally unstable and not at his full, stable power level.

The general consensus among comic fans is that while the Hulk is known for getting stronger the angrier he gets, Sentry's power level, when he is stable and not held back by his mental issues, is arguably higher. When the Void comes into play, he's shown to be even more powerful, and even Hulk has been unable to defeat him.
