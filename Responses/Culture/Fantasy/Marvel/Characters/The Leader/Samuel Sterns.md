Samuel Sterns, also known as The Leader, is a character from the Marvel Comics universe and a major villain in *Captain America: Brave New World*.

### In the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)

Samuel Sterns first appeared in the film *The Incredible Hulk* (2008), where he was a cellular biologist who helped Bruce Banner (the Hulk) try to find a cure for his condition. At the end of that movie, Sterns' head was exposed to gamma-irradiated blood, causing it to swell and foreshadowing his transformation into The Leader.

In *Captain America: Brave New World*, it's revealed that following this accident, Sterns was imprisoned. The gamma radiation enhanced his intelligence to a genius level, making him an incredibly dangerous strategic and technological threat. He is the main antagonist of the film, using his intelligence and new abilities to challenge Captain America.

### In the Comics

In the comics, Samuel Sterns was a janitor who was exposed to gamma radiation, which mutated him into a green-skinned, super-intelligent villain. He took on the name "The Leader" and became one of the Hulk's archenemies, a rival who fights with his mind instead of brute strength. He has a variety of mental powers, including telekinesis and the ability to control others' minds.
