In *Captain America: Brave New World*, Samuel Sterns, as The Leader, utilizes his vastly enhanced intellect to create advanced technology that drives the film's plot. His creations are a key part of his master plan and a reflection of his new abilities.

Based on the movie's plot, some of the technologies he develops include:

* **Mind Control Technology:** The Leader uses a specific device that manipulates minds through a combination of light and sound. He uses this technology to control a super soldier and to target the President of the United States, Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, who has become his nemesis.
* **Gamma Radiation Technology:** Sterns's research into gamma radiation is central to the story. He uses his knowledge to develop a series of pills that he gives to General Ross, which ultimately leads to Ross's transformation into the Red Hulk. This shows his deep understanding of gamma-based science and his ability to weaponize it.
* **Synthetic Servants:** In the comics, The Leader is known for creating an army of "Humanoids" to do his bidding. While the movie may not feature a full army of these, his technological prowess allows him to create and control sophisticated devices.

The Leader's use of technology and intellect as his primary weapon is what makes him such a dangerous foe for Captain America, who relies on physical strength and combat skills. The conflict between brute force and superior intelligence is a classic sci-fi trope that you may find interesting, similar to the intellectual battles in movies like *Inception* or *Arrival*.
