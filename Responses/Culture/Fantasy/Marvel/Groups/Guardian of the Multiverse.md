"Guardians of the Multiverse" refers to a team assembled by The Watcher in Marvel's animated series *What If...?* In the show, The Watcher, who typically observes events across the multiverse, breaks his oath of non-interference to bring together powerful variants of familiar heroes to combat a multiversal threat, specifically an Infinity Stone-powered Ultron. The team includes characters like Captain Carter, Party Thor, T'Challa/Star-Lord, Doctor Strange Supreme, and others.

While there isn't a specific live-action movie titled "Guardian of the Multiverse," the concept of the multiverse and its protection has been a central theme in recent Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films like *Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness* and the upcoming *Avengers: Doomsday* and *Avengers: Secret Wars*.

Given your enjoyment of movies that make you think, like *Inception* and *The Platform*, and your interest in sci-fi and time travel movies such as *Arrival*, *Back to the Future*, and *Edge of Tomorrow*, the concept of the multiverse and the different realities explored in *What If...?* might be something you'd find quite interesting. It definitely plays with those "what if" scenarios and alternate realities.
