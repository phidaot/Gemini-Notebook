The Marvel Illuminati is a secret society of powerful and influential superheroes from the Marvel Comics universe. The group was formed after the Kree-Skrull War when Iron Man realized that if they had shared information beforehand, they could have prevented the conflict.

The original core members of the Illuminati are:

Iron Man (Tony Stark): Represents the Avengers and the common man, using technology and his vast intellect.

Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards): Represents the Fantastic Four and the scientific community.

Doctor Strange: Represents the mystical side of the Marvel Universe as the Sorcerer Supreme.

Black Bolt: The king of the Inhumans.

Professor Charles Xavier: The leader of the X-Men, representing the mutant community.

Namor the Sub-Mariner: The king of Atlantis, representing the antihero mindset and the world's oceans.

Other heroes like Black Panther, Captain America, and Medusa have also been members at various times. The group operates in secret, making decisions and shaping major events from behind the scenes, sometimes without the knowledge or consent of other heroes.

You mentioned you enjoy the movie Everything, Everywhere All At Once, which features a multiverse plot. The Illuminati were also featured in the movie Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, where they were a different version of the team from an alternate Earth (Earth-838). This version had a different lineup, including Captain Carter and Captain Marvel, and their brief appearance was a key part of the movie's multiverse story.
