The Council of Ricks is a prominent organization in the **Rick and Morty** universe. Here's a quick rundown:

* **Who they are:** They're a governing body made up of Ricks from across various dimensions. Their original purpose was to protect Ricks and maintain order within the multiverse, particularly within the **Central Finite Curve**, a section of the multiverse where Ricks are the smartest beings.
* **The Citadel of Ricks:** The Council operates from the Citadel of Ricks, a massive, interdimensional space station that serves as a hub for Ricks and their Mortys from countless realities.
* **Their role:** Initially, they were portrayed as a somewhat bureaucratic and self-serving entity, often clashing with our "main" Rick (Rick C-137) due to his rebellious nature. They've also been responsible for creating things like the "Morty Waves" to mask Rick's genius.
* **Evolution and downfall:** The Council has gone through various iterations and leadership changes, including a period with a democratically elected Morty as president. Ultimately, the original Council of Ricks was dismantled and largely destroyed by Rick C-137 in a significant plot point in the series.

The comics have also explored the secret origins of the Council, delving into how they were initially formed to prevent any single autocratic Rick from gaining too much power.
