The term "Visored" (or Vaizard, depending on the translation) refers to a group of characters in the anime and manga series **Bleach**. 

Here's a breakdown of what they are:

* **Soul Reapers with Hollow Powers:** The Visored are unique because they are **Soul Reapers** (beings who purify Hollows and guide souls to the Soul Society) who have gained the powers of **Hollows** (corrupted spirits). This gives them access to a Hollow mask, which significantly boosts their strength, speed, and spiritual energy.
* **Forced Transformation:** Their transformation wasn't voluntary. They were victims of an experiment conducted by **Sosuke Aizen** (a main antagonist in the series) many years prior to the main storyline. Aizen used a process called "Hollowfication" on them, which caused them to partially transform into Hollows.
* **Exiled from Soul Society:** Because of their Hollow powers, they were ostracized and exiled from the Soul Society, which views Hollows as enemies. They lived in hiding in the human world for a long time.
* **Ichigo's Mentors:** A key role they play in the series is helping the protagonist, **Ichigo Kurosaki**, learn to control his own latent Hollow powers. Ichigo, being a hybrid of various spiritual races, also experiences Hollowfication.
* **Distinctive Appearance:** When using their Hollow powers, they manifest unique masks that resemble various Hollow types.

You mentioned you used to watch a lot of *Bleach*, so you're likely familiar with characters like **Shinji Hirako**, **Hiyori Sarugaki**, **Kensei Muguruma**, and **Rose Otoribashi**, who are all prominent members of the Visored. They're known for their distinct personalities and fighting styles, blending Soul Reaper abilities with their Hollow strengths.
