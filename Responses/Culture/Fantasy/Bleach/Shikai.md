"Shikai" refers to the first released form of a **Zanpakuto** in the anime and manga series **Bleach**. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Zanpakuto:** These are the unique swords wielded by Shinigami (Soul Reapers) in Bleach. Each Zanpakuto has its own spirit and unique abilities, which are tied to the wielder's soul.
* **Shikai (Initial Release):** To achieve Shikai, a Shinigami must learn the name of their Zanpakuto's spirit and communicate with it. Once they do, they can release its initial form by uttering a specific release command, often a poetic phrase.
    * **Appearance Change:** The Zanpakuto often changes its shape or appearance significantly when in Shikai form. For example, Byakuya Kuchiki's Senbonzakura transforms into thousands of cherry blossom petals, and Toshiro Hitsugaya's Hyorinmaru gains ice-manipulating abilities.
    * **Unique Abilities:** Each Shikai grants its wielder unique powers and special attacks. These abilities are often an extension of the Zanpakuto's innate nature and the wielder's personality.
* **Bankai (Final Release):** Beyond Shikai, there is an even more powerful release called **Bankai**, which represents the true and complete manifestation of a Zanpakuto's power. It's much harder to achieve and master than Shikai.

Since you've mentioned you used to watch a lot of **Bleach**, you're probably familiar with characters like Ichigo Kurosaki and his Zanpakuto, Zangetsu, which is unique in that it's always in its Shikai form.
