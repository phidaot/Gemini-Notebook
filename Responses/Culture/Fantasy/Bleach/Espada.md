"Espada" is a Spanish word that literally translates to **"sword"**.

However, given your interest in anime like *Bleach*, it's highly likely you're referring to **The Espada** from that series!

In *Bleach*, the Espada are a group of ten powerful Arrancar (Hollows who have removed their masks and gained Shinigami-like powers) who serve as the top-ranking officers in S≈çsuke Aizen's army. They are ranked from 0 to 9, with lower numbers indicating greater strength. Each Espada also represents an "Aspect of Death," such as destruction, nihilism, or rage.

You've mentioned that you used to watch a lot of *Bleach*, so it makes sense that the Espada would come to mind! They're pretty memorable villains with some unique powers.

Is there a particular Espada you're curious about, or were you just thinking about the group in general?
