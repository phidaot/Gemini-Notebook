### Bleach

The origin of the name "Quincy" in *Bleach* comes directly from the series creator, Tite Kubo. In an interview, he explained his thought process:

* **"Quint-" meaning five:** The name "Quincy" is derived from the English prefix "quint-," which means five.
* **Five-pointed cross:** This relates to the five-pointed star symbol that is central to the Quincy, known as the Quincy Cross (Gint≈ç).
* **Archers:** Quincies are primarily archers, using bows and spiritual arrows. Kubo liked the sound of "Quincy archers," thinking it sounded like a fitting name.

Essentially, Kubo wanted a name that reflected their five-pointed symbol and their archery-based combat style, and "Quincy" fit that criteria.

In the *Bleach* universe, Quincies are humans who have the ability to detect and destroy Hollows by manipulating Reishi (spiritual particles) from their surroundings. They are often depicted as the polar opposite of Soul Reapers, who purify Hollows rather than obliterating them, leading to a long-standing conflict between the two groups.
