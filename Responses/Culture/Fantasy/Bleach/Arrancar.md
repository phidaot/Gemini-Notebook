"Arrancar" is a Spanish verb that has a variety of meanings, most of which revolve around the idea of **starting, pulling, or tearing something**. 

Here are some of the most common uses:

* **To start:** This is often used for machines, vehicles, or even a game. For example, "Arrancar el coche" means "to start the car."
* **To pull out/up/off:** This can apply to anything from a tooth ("arrancar una muela") to weeds ("arrancar las malas hierbas") or a page from a book ("arrancar una página").
* **To tear/rip:** Similar to pulling, but with more force or a tearing motion.
* **To set off/depart:** Often used informally to mean "to get going" or "to leave quickly."
* **To obtain/extract (with effort):** For example, to "arrancar un suspiro" (to draw a sigh) or to "arrancar una confesión" (to extract a confession).

It's a very versatile word, and its exact meaning often depends on the context.

Given your past interest in **Bleach**, it's worth noting that "Arrancar" also refers to a specific group of characters in that anime and manga series. In the world of Bleach, Arrancar are Hollows who have removed their masks and gained Shinigami-like powers. They are generally more powerful and intelligent than regular Hollows.

### Removing Mask

In the world of Bleach, the reason Hollows become stronger by removing their masks to become Arrancar is a complex process that essentially refines and condenses their power, giving them a more human-like form and Shinigami-like abilities.

Here's a breakdown of the key reasons:

* **Reclaiming Humanity and Intelligence:** A Hollow's mask is a symbol of their lost humanity and their monstrous nature. By removing it (or having it broken), they essentially shed some of that monstrousness and regain a significant degree of their human intellect and reasoning. This allows them to wield their power with much greater precision, strategy, and control, rather than just acting on instinctual hunger and malice.

* **Refining Spiritual Pressure (Reiatsu):** When a Hollow removes its mask, their spiritual pressure, or Reiatsu, becomes more condensed and focused. Instead of being a wild, chaotic surge of energy, it becomes more refined and potent, allowing for more efficient and powerful techniques. This transformation is akin to a raw, untamed force being honed into a sharp weapon.

* **Gaining Shinigami-like Abilities:** The most significant aspect of becoming an Arrancar is gaining abilities reminiscent of Shinigami. This includes:
    * **Zanpakuto:** Arrancar manifest their power into a Zanpakuto, just like Shinigami. However, unlike Shinigami Zanpakuto which seal their powers, an Arrancar's Zanpakuto actually **contains** their full Hollow power.
    * **Resurrección:** This is the Arrancar's equivalent of a Shinigami's Bankai. By releasing their Zanpakuto, an Arrancar transforms into a state that resembles their original Hollow form, but with massively amplified power, speed, and unique abilities. This is where their true power is unleashed.
    * **Sonido:** Their version of the Shinigami's Flash Step (Shunpo), allowing for incredibly high-speed movement.
    * **Bala:** A weaker, but faster, projectile made of solidified Reiatsu, similar to a Cero but less destructive.
    * **Cero:** A powerful blast of concentrated spiritual energy. While regular Hollows can use Cero, Arrancar often have more potent and varied forms of it.

* **The Hogyoku's Influence (for Aizen's Arrancar):** While some Hollows can naturally become Arrancar (like Starrk or Ulquiorra), Sosuke Aizen utilized the Hogyoku to forcibly accelerate and refine this process for many Hollows, creating an army of incredibly powerful Arrancar, including the Espada. The Hogyoku's influence pushed their evolution beyond what might occur naturally, granting them even greater power and stability.

In essence, the mask removal isn't just a physical act; it's a profound spiritual transformation that allows a Hollow to evolve, gain higher intelligence, and control their immense spiritual power in a more refined and effective way, bridging the gap between Hollow and Shinigami abilities.
