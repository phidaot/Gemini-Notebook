The Fullbringer arc (also known as the "Lost Agent Arc") in *Bleach* is a somewhat controversial but ultimately important storyline that focuses on Ichigo Kurosaki after he loses his Soul Reaper powers following his battle with Aizen.

Here's a breakdown of the Fullbringer arc and what Fullbringers are:

**What are Fullbringers?**

Fullbringers are humans born with a unique ability called **Fullbring**. This power stems from having a fragment of the Soul King's soul within them, which attracts Hollows to their pregnant mothers. Surviving the Hollow attack results in the child being born with Fullbring.

Their power allows them to manipulate the "soul" of objects they have a strong emotional connection to. The closer the object is to them, the more effectively they can manipulate its soul. This can manifest in various ways, such as:

* **Manipulating matter:** They can affect the physical properties of objects, like making a wall disintegrate into sand or controlling water and air.
* **Enhancing their own bodies:** They can empower their physical attacks, stand on water, or even make themselves intangible.
* **Unique abilities:** Each Fullbringer develops a distinct power based on their chosen object and personal connection. Examples include:
    * **Tsukishima's "Book of the End":** Allows him to insert himself into a target's past, altering their memories and loyalties.
    * **Yukio's "Invaders Must Die":** Creates digital dimensions that can be manipulated at will.
    * **Riruka's "Dollhouse":** Can "trap" people or objects inside other objects.
    * **Chad's "Brazo Derecha de Gigante" and "Brazo Izquierda del Diablo":** His right arm has defensive and offensive capabilities, while his left arm can unleash powerful spiritual attacks. (It's revealed in this arc that Chad's powers are a form of Fullbring).
    * **Orihime's "Soten Kisshun":** Her abilities to reject events (healing, shields) are also a form of Fullbring.

**The Fullbringer Arc's Significance:**

The arc largely revolves around Ichigo's struggle with his power loss and his desire to protect his friends and family. Feeling helpless, he encounters a group of Fullbringers called Xcution, who offer to help him regain his Soul Reaper powers.

Key aspects and themes of the arc:

* **Ichigo's Character Development:** Stripped of his powers, Ichigo is forced to confront his vulnerabilities and his identity beyond being a Soul Reaper. He learns to rely on a different type of power and grows emotionally.
* **Grounded Storytelling:** Unlike previous arcs with grand-scale battles against otherworldly threats, the Fullbringer arc is more personal and set primarily in the human world. The conflicts often involve psychological manipulation and strategy.
* **Expansion of *Bleach* Lore:** It introduces a new type of human ability and further connects the human world to the spiritual side of the *Bleach* universe, explaining the origins of powers like Chad's and Orihime's.
* **Controversy and Importance:** While some fans consider it slow or less exciting than other arcs, many argue it's crucial for Ichigo's overall journey and sets the stage for the final arc by explaining how he regains his powers in a new, more profound way.

For you, as someone who enjoyed *Bleach* in the past, the Fullbringer arc offers a different pace and focus. It delves into the internal struggles of Ichigo and explores more about the human side of the *Bleach* world, which might be an interesting change of pace from the typical Soul Reaper vs. Hollow/Arrancar battles.
