You're likely thinking of "Resurrección" from the anime and manga series **Bleach**!

In Bleach, **Resurrección** (which is Spanish for "resurrection" and often translated as "returning blade" in the series) is the unique ability of **Arrancars** to release the sealed form of their **Zanpakutō**.

Here's a quick breakdown:

* **Arrancars** are Hollows who have removed their masks and gained Shinigami-like powers, including the ability to seal their Hollow essence into a sword called a Zanpakutō.
* When an Arrancar activates their Resurrección, they revert to a more complete, and often more powerful, version of their original Hollow form. This transformation typically grants them enhanced abilities, unique techniques, and a significant boost in power, similar to how a Shinigami's Bankai works.
* The appearance of their Resurrección often reflects their original Hollow form or a significant aspect of their Hollow abilities.

You mentioned you used to watch a lot of **Bleach**, so this connection probably makes sense to you! It's a key part of the power system for the Arrancars and leads to some pretty wild character designs and fights.
