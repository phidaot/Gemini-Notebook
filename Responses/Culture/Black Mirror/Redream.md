That's an excellent question, and it speaks to the interconnectedness often found in "Black Mirror" episodes, even as they're typically standalone.
While the specific "Redream" system is introduced as a new technology in the "Hotel Reverie" episode of Season 7, the concept of digitally recreating or immersing consciousness into virtual or simulated realities has been a recurring theme throughout "Black Mirror."
For example:
 * San Junipero: This beloved episode (which you enjoy!) deals with a similar idea â€“ people choosing to live their consciousness in a simulated afterlife. While it's not "Redream," the underlying tech of transferring consciousness and creating immersive digital worlds shares a clear thematic lineage. In fact, "Hotel Reverie" has been described by creator Charlie Brooker as a "spiritual sequel" to "San Junipero," and there's an explicit Easter egg at the end of "Hotel Reverie" with a package addressed to "Junipero Drive."
 * USS Callister: This episode features a developer who creates a simulated game world where he has control over digital clones of his co-workers. Again, it involves digital consciousness and immersive realities. Notably, the company that manufactures the "Nubbin" device used in "USS Callister" (TCKR) is also referenced as the company behind Redream in "Hotel Reverie," further linking the technologies within the Black Mirror universe.
 * Playtest: This episode explores a hyper-realistic virtual reality game that blurs the lines between reality and simulation.
So, while "Redream" itself is specific to "Hotel Reverie," the underlying ideas about virtual reality, consciousness transfer, and digital immersion are very much a part of "Black Mirror's" recurring technological anxieties and explorations. The show often reuses company names (like TCKR) or makes subtle nods (like "Junipero Drive") to suggest a shared universe, even if the technologies themselves are distinct iterations.
