"Hold on just a little while longer" is a powerful and moving song, and Evan Parke's performance as Luther in *Detroit: Become Human* gives it a unique character. While there isn't a specific, detailed breakdown of his singing style available, we can analyze the performance itself based on what's known.

First, it's important to note that the song is a classic gospel hymn, originally by Cleophus Robinson Jr., which gives it a soulful and spiritual foundation. This is a key element of the song's emotional weight.

When Luther sings it, it feels like a song of quiet resilience and hope. The voice is strong and clear, but there's a certain restraint to it. It's not a performance full of soaring, dramatic belts. Instead, the power comes from a deep, unwavering conviction. The annunciation is precise, but the tone is warm and grounded, giving the impression of someone finding strength in a time of great uncertainty. The song feels less like a performance and more like a sincere prayer or a comforting reassurance. This style perfectly matches the character of Luther, a gentle giant who becomes a protector and a pillar of strength for others.
