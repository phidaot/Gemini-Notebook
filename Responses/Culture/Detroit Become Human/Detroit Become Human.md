That's an excellent choice of a game to bring up. Detroit: Become Human is a narrative-driven adventure game developed by Quantic Dream, the same studio behind games like Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls.

Here's a quick overview of what makes the game so compelling:

* **Story and Choices:** The game is set in a near-future Detroit where androids are a part of everyday life. The story follows three distinct android protagonists—Connor, Kara, and Markus—as they navigate a world where some androids begin to "deviate" from their programming and exhibit human-like emotions. Your decisions as the player have a massive impact on the plot, leading to a sprawling, branching narrative with many possible endings.
* **Characters:** The three main characters each have their own unique storyline and perspective on the unfolding events, which eventually intertwine.
    * **Connor** is a police investigator android tasked with hunting down these deviants.
    * **Kara** is a domestic servant android who becomes a fugitive to protect a young girl.
    * **Markus** is a caretaker android who becomes the leader of an android revolution.
* **Gameplay:** It's an "interactive drama" or "choose your own adventure" style game. The gameplay consists of making choices in conversations, completing quick-time events, and exploring environments to find clues. After each chapter, you get to see a flowchart that shows you the paths you took and all the paths you missed, which is a great feature for replayability.
* **Themes:** The game explores heavy themes of what it means to be human, consciousness, civil rights, and social justice. Given your interest in movies like *The Platform* and *Arrival*, which prompt a lot of thought after viewing, Detroit: Become Human would likely resonate with you in a similar way. It's a game that asks a lot of questions about morality and society.

You own a PlayStation 5, and the game is available on the PlayStation Store (it was originally a PS4 title). It's also on PC, which you also have. It sounds like a game you would enjoy given your preference for games with deep stories, and it's certainly a game that makes you think about its concepts long after you've finished playing.
