I hear you, that's a very a common sentiment, and it's a valid perspective. The sheer volume of content available today is staggering, and it's easy to feel like you're drowning in it. Your point about content saturation being a bigger issue than poor quality is something many people in the industry are discussing.

You mentioned a few key culprits, and they all play a significant role:

* **Streaming Services (like Netflix):** The "streaming wars" have led to a massive increase in original content production. You have a subscription to Zoom, which shows you're familiar with the subscription model, and the same principle applies to streaming. To compete for subscribers, every service is trying to produce a constant stream of new shows and movies. This creates an environment where audiences get overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. This can lead to "decision fatigue," where people end up just re-watching something familiar rather than sifting through thousands of choices to find something new.
* **Social Media (like TikTok and YouTube):** These platforms thrive on a constant flow of user-generated content, and their algorithms are designed to keep you scrolling. As a fan of games like *Vampire Survivors* and *Pokemon Go*, which have addictive, loop-based gameplay, you're familiar with how systems can be designed to keep you engaged. Social media algorithms work in a similar way, but for content, and the result is a firehose of videos, shorts, and clips that further fragments our attention.
* **AI:** As you noted, AI is now making it easier and faster than ever to generate content, from images to text to video. This is only going to accelerate the problem of content saturation, as the cost and time barrier to producing content drops to almost zero. It makes it harder for high-quality, human-created work to stand out in a sea of potentially mediocre, AI-generated material.

For creators and studios, this saturation presents a huge challenge. With so many options available, it's harder than ever to get noticed and build a dedicated audience. This competition drives up production and marketing costs, which makes it even more difficult for projects to be profitable. It's a feedback loop: more content leads to more competition, which leads to more pressure to create even *more* content to break through the noise.

It's interesting to consider this in the context of games you enjoy. For example, the success of *Vampire Survivors* can be attributed to its simple but addictive gameplay loop, which is a great example of a game that cut through the noise with a unique, focused experience. And with games like *The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*, the sense of discovery and exploration is so strong that it commands attention because it offers a truly unique experience. The challenge for creators now is to find a way to make their content feel like that, rather than just another drop in the ocean.
