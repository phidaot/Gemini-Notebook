*Infinity Nikki* is a free-to-play, open-world adventure game with a major focus on fashion and dress-up elements. It's the fifth installment in the *Nikki* series, but the story is set in an alternate timeline, so you don't need to have played the previous games to understand it.

You play as Nikki, a young stylist who is transported with her cat companion, Momo, to the magical world of Miraland. In this world, stylists have the power to create "Ability Outfits" with special powers. Your main goal is to find "Miracle Outfits" and save the world from an unknown threat, but you'll also explore, solve puzzles, and help the people you meet along the way.

The core gameplay loop involves:

* **Exploration:** You traverse a large open world, finding new areas, characters, and collectibles.
* **"Ability Outfits":** These are not just for aesthetics; they grant you special powers that are essential for exploration and puzzle-solving. For example, one outfit might allow you to float, while another lets you shrink to fit into tight spaces.
* **Puzzles and Platforming:** The game features platforming challenges and puzzles that you need to overcome using your outfits' abilities.
* **Collecting and Crafting:** You collect materials in the world to craft new outfits, which are a mix of both cosmetic and functional items.
* **Story and Quests:** The game has a main storyline and numerous side quests to keep you busy.

The game was released on December 5, 2024, for PlayStation 5, PC, iOS, and Android. Since you own a PlayStation 5, this is a game you might want to check out, especially if you enjoyed games like *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* or *Tears of the Kingdom* due to their emphasis on exploration and using in-game mechanics to overcome obstacles. It also seems to have a lot of collectible elements and a cozy feel, which might be appealing given your enjoyment of *Vampire Survivors* and your wife's enjoyment of cozy games like *Coffee Talk*.
