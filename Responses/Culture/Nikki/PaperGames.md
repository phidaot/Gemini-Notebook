* **Mr Love: Queen's Choice (2017):** This is a popular "otome" or romance-simulation game aimed at a female audience. It features a story where the player character, a TV producer, encounters four male love interests with superpowers. It's known for its detailed story, voice acting, and card-collecting mechanics.

* **Love and Deepspace (2024):** A more recent 3D romance-simulation game. It features a similar premise to *Mr Love: Queen's Choice* but with a sci-fi setting and more immersive 3D graphics and interactive elements. It has been quite popular since its release.

Papergames has also been exploring other genres with a few announced projects, including *Project: The Perceiver*, which looks to be a more action-oriented game. The company is known for its high-quality art direction, detailed character models, and a strong emphasis on storytelling and emotional connection in their games.
