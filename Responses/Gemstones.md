Gemstones are minerals, rocks, or organic materials that have been cut, polished, and used for jewelry or other adornments due to their beauty, durability, and rarity. While most are minerals, some, like amber (fossilized tree resin) and pearl (from mollusks), are organic.

Here are some key characteristics and types of gemstones:

### Characteristics
* **Color**: A gemstone's color is often its most valued characteristic. It can be caused by the stone's chemical composition or by the presence of trace elements.
* **Clarity**: Refers to the presence of internal features called "inclusions." These can sometimes be used to identify a stone's origin and whether it's natural or synthetic.
* **Cut**: The way a gemstone is shaped and polished to enhance its brilliance and light-reflecting properties. Common cuts include cabochon (a smooth, rounded shape) and faceted (many flat surfaces).
* **Carat**: A unit of weight for gemstones, with 5 carats equaling 1 gram.
* **Hardness**: Measured on the Mohs scale, which rates a mineral's resistance to scratching from 1 (softest, like talc) to 10 (hardest, like diamond).

### Formation
Gemstones form under a variety of geological conditions, typically deep within the Earth's crust or mantle.
* **Molten Rock**: Some, like diamonds, form under immense heat and pressure and are brought to the surface by volcanic eruptions.
* **Hydrothermal Deposits**: Others, such as tourmaline and emerald, crystallize from mineral-rich hot fluids and gases as they cool.
* **Metamorphic Processes**: Sapphires and rubies form when existing rocks are subjected to heat and pressure from tectonic plate movements, causing them to recrystallize into new materials.

### Types of Gemstones
While the distinction between "precious" and "semi-precious" is an old one, the most well-known gems considered precious are:
* **Diamond**: A form of carbon, known for its brilliance and being the hardest natural substance.
* **Ruby**: The red variety of the mineral corundum, with the color coming from chromium.
* **Sapphire**: Also a variety of corundum, but in any color other than red. Blue is the most famous, but they can be yellow, pink, green, and more.
* **Emerald**: A green variety of the mineral beryl.

There is a vast list of other gemstones, including:
* **Amethyst**: A purple variety of quartz.
* **Aquamarine**: A blue to greenish-blue variety of beryl.
* **Garnet**: A group of related minerals that come in many colors, though red is the most common.
* **Opal**: Known for its "play of color," which is a flashing display of rainbow shades.
* **Pearl**: An organic gemstone formed within mollusks.
