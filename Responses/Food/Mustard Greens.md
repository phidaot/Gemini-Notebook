It's certainly possible! Wild mustard (often *Sinapis arvensis* or *Brassica kaber*) is a common weed throughout much of the United States, including Michigan where you live. There's also an invasive species called Garlic Mustard (*Alliaria petiolata*) that's widespread in Michigan, which is also edible.

Here's what you need to know about distinguishing them and what to do:

### How to Identify Wild Mustard (e.g., *Sinapis arvensis*)

* **Leaves:** Young leaves are often oblong, egg to club-shaped, with wavy-toothed edges and stiff hairs on both leaves and stems. Lower leaves on mature plants are more prominently lobed and often broadest at the tip. Upper leaves are smaller, less lobed, and have shorter or no stalks.
* **Flowers:** Bright yellow flowers with four petals, typically 1.5 cm (3/5‚Äù) wide, appear in clusters at the ends of branches.
* **Stems:** Upright and branched at the top, with bristly hairs on the lower portions.
* **Seeds/Pods:** Long, narrow fruit capsules (siliques) 2-5 cm long, with a square-sided conical beak about half as long as the pod. Seeds are round, smooth, and black or dark purple-brown.
* **Smell:** Generally has a characteristic "mustard-y" smell when crushed, but not typically a strong garlic odor.

### How to Identify Garlic Mustard (*Alliaria petiolata*) - An Invasive, Edible Weed

This is a very common invasive plant in Michigan. It's also edible, but it's crucial to remove it to protect native plants.

* **First-year plants (rosettes):** Low-growing, dark green, kidney-shaped leaves with scalloped, almost toothed edges. They remain green through winter.
* **Second-year plants:** Develop a stem (bolt) up to 1 meter (3 feet) tall, with alternating, triangular to heart-shaped leaves that have coarser teeth. The stems are often hairy.
* **Flowers:** Small white flowers with four petals, usually appearing in early April to June.
* **Smell:** This is a key identifier! The leaves and stems give off a distinct **garlic smell** when crushed.
* **Seed pods:** Long, slender green pods that turn brown in the fall, each containing small black seeds. A single plant can produce thousands of seeds.

### Important Considerations for Foraging:

1.  **Positive Identification is CRUCIAL:** While members of the mustard family are generally edible, it's absolutely vital to be 100% sure of your identification. There are some toxic look-alikes for other wild plants, so if you're not completely confident, it's best not to consume it. The "smell test" (for garlic mustard) is a good indicator.
2.  **Location:** Be mindful of where you're foraging. Avoid plants that might have been sprayed with herbicides or are in areas with high pollution (e.g., roadsides). Given it's in your garden, you likely know its history.
3.  **Harvesting:**
    * **Wild Mustard:** The leaves are best when young and tender. As they mature, they can become more bitter.
    * **Garlic Mustard:** Best harvested when young and less bitter. Older plants can be cooked thoroughly.
4.  **Invasive Status (Garlic Mustard):** If it is garlic mustard, harvesting it is actually a great way to help control its spread! It's an aggressive invader that outcompetes native plants. When pulling it, try to remove the entire root system to prevent regrowth, and if it has gone to seed, bag the plants and dispose of them in the trash (not compost) to prevent further spread.

If you can provide a description of the leaves (shape, hairiness, how they attach to the stem) and if they have any flowers (color, number of petals), I might be able to help you narrow down which type of wild mustard you have. You could also compare your plants to images online from reliable sources like university extension sites (like Michigan State University's weed identification resources).
