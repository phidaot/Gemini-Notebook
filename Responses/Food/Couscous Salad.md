**Mediterranean Couscous Salad**

This recipe uses a quick-cooking couscous, making it super fast to prepare.

**Yields:** 4 servings
**Prep time:** 15 minutes
**Cook time:** 5 minutes

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup (about 180g) instant couscous
* 1 cup (240ml) boiling water or vegetable broth
* 1/2 English cucumber, diced
* 1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered
* 1/2 red onion, finely diced (or 2-3 green onions, thinly sliced for a milder flavor)
* 1/2 cup pitted Kalamata olives, halved
* 1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped
* 1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped (optional, but highly recommended for freshness)
* 1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional)

**For the Lemon-Herb Vinaigrette:**

* 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* 1 clove garlic, minced (or 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder)
* 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
* Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

**Instructions:**

1.  **Prepare the couscous:** In a medium-sized heatproof bowl, combine the couscous with the boiling water or vegetable broth. Stir once, then cover the bowl tightly with a lid or plastic wrap and let it sit for 5 minutes, or until all the liquid has been absorbed.
2.  **Fluff the couscous:** After 5 minutes, uncover the couscous and fluff it with a fork to separate the grains. Let it cool for a few minutes while you prepare the other ingredients.
3.  **Prepare the vegetables and herbs:** While the couscous is cooling, dice the cucumber, halve the cherry tomatoes, finely dice the red onion (or slice green onions), halve the Kalamata olives, and chop the fresh parsley and mint.
4.  **Make the vinaigrette:** In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and pepper until well combined.
5.  **Combine the salad:** Add the cooled, fluffed couscous to a large mixing bowl. Add the diced cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion (or green onions), Kalamata olives, parsley, and mint. If using, add the crumbled feta cheese.
6.  **Dress the salad:** Pour the lemon-herb vinaigrette over the couscous and vegetable mixture. Toss gently to combine everything thoroughly, ensuring all ingredients are coated with the dressing.
7.  **Serve:** You can serve the couscous salad immediately at room temperature, or chill it in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes for the flavors to meld, especially if you prefer it cold.

**Tips and Variations:**

* **Add protein:** Grilled chicken, chickpeas, or canned tuna would be great additions to make this a more substantial meal.
* **Other vegetables:** Bell peppers (red, yellow, or orange), sun-dried tomatoes, or artichoke hearts would also work well.
* **Spices:** A pinch of cumin or smoked paprika can add a different dimension of flavor.
* **Storage:** Store any leftover couscous salad in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3-4 days.
