Benzonatate (commonly known by brand names like Tessalon Perles) is a prescription cough suppressant. It works by numbing the stretch receptors in your lungs and airways, which helps to reduce the cough reflex.
Here are some key points about benzonatate:
 * Uses: It's primarily used to relieve coughs caused by conditions like the common cold or flu. It's generally not for chronic coughs (e.g., from smoking, asthma, emphysema) or coughs with a lot of mucus.
 * How it works: It's a non-narcotic antitussive. It's thought to act as a local anesthetic, decreasing the sensitivity of the areas involved in the cough reflex.
 * Administration: It's taken by mouth, usually as a capsule.
 * Important warning: The capsules should always be swallowed whole and never chewed, sucked on, or dissolved in the mouth. Doing so can cause numbing of the mouth and throat, leading to choking or severe allergic reactions.
 * Onset and Duration: Effects typically begin within 15-20 minutes and can last for 3 to 8 hours.
 * Side Effects: Common side effects can include drowsiness, dizziness, headache, constipation, nausea, or upset stomach. Serious side effects are rare but can occur, especially if the capsule is not swallowed whole.
 * Prescription Only: Benzonatate is only available with a doctor's prescription.
 * Children: It's not recommended for children under 10 years of age due to the risk of accidental overdose, which can be very dangerous or even fatal.
If you have a cough and are considering medication, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific condition.
