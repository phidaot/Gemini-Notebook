Based on various studies and expert opinions, eating late at night can have some negative health effects, but the impact can vary from person to person. It's not a simple "yes or no" answer, as a lot depends on what you eat, how much, and your personal health and lifestyle.

Here's a summary of the potential issues and some tips for late-night eating:

### Potential Downsides of Eating Late
* **Acid Reflux and Heartburn:** Eating a large, heavy meal within two to three hours of lying down can trigger acid production in your stomach. When you lie down, this acid can move up into the esophagus, causing discomfort and heartburn.
* **Disrupted Sleep:** Digestion is a complex process that can raise your body temperature and heart rate. Eating a heavy meal close to bedtime can interfere with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle (circadian rhythm) and make it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep.
* **Weight Gain:** Studies suggest that eating late can impact how your body manages calories. Your metabolism slows down at night, so the calories from a late-night meal may be more likely to be stored as fat rather than being burned for energy. Additionally, late-night snacks are often high in fat and sugar, and people may eat mindlessly in front of a screen, leading to excess calorie consumption.
* **Increased Risk of Certain Health Conditions:** Consistently eating late at night has been linked to an increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes, as it can negatively affect blood sugar management and insulin sensitivity.

### What to Do If You're Hungry at Night
It's not always realistic to avoid eating late, especially with a busy family schedule. If you find yourself needing a snack before bed, here are some recommendations:

* **Keep it Light:** Opt for a small, low-calorie snack (under 250 calories) rather than a full meal.
* **Choose Wisely:** Focus on nutrient-dense foods. A handful of almonds, a piece of fruit, or some Greek yogurt are often better choices than high-fat or sugary foods like chips or ice cream.
* **Avoid Triggers:** Steer clear of things that are likely to cause discomfort, such as spicy, fatty, or highly sugary foods.
* **Give Yourself a Buffer:** Try to finish eating at least two to three hours before you plan to go to sleep. This gives your body enough time to digest the food.

For example, since you mentioned you enjoy playing *Vampire Survivors* with your son, a good late-night option after a gaming session could be a light, healthy snack that won't disrupt your sleep.
