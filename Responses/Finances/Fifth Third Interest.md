Fifth Third Bank offers varying interest rates across its different account types. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect, based on currently available information:

**Checking Accounts:**
* **Fifth Third Preferred Checking:** This is an interest-bearing checking account that typically earns a low Annual Percentage Yield (APY), often around **0.01% APY**. While it earns interest, its main benefit is access to other perks and potential fee waivers if you maintain a high combined balance across your Fifth Third accounts.
* **Fifth Third Momentum Checking:** This account generally **does not earn interest**. Its focus is on no monthly service fees, no minimum balance, and features like "Extra Time" to help avoid overdraft fees.

**Savings Accounts:**
* **Fifth Third Momentum Savings:** This account typically offers a very low APY, often around **0.01% APY**. It has a monthly service fee that can be waived by meeting certain conditions (e.g., having a Fifth Third Checking Account, maintaining an average monthly balance of at least $500, or being under 18).
* **Fifth Third Relationship Money Market:** The standard interest rate for this account is generally low, around **0.01% APY**. However, Fifth Third has historically offered **promotional rates** for new money market accounts, which can be significantly higher (e.g., past promotions have been as high as 5.30% APY for a limited time). These promotional rates usually come with specific terms, such as a minimum deposit and a limited time frame for the high APY.
* **Health Savings Account (HSA):** Fifth Third HSAs can offer tiered APYs, with higher balances potentially earning a slightly better rate (e.g., 1.00% APY for balances of $15,000+).

**Certificates of Deposit (CDs):**
Fifth Third Bank offers both standard and promotional CDs.
* **Promotional CDs** generally offer much higher interest rates than their standard counterparts. As of late May/early July 2025, some promotional CD rates observed include:
    * **6-Month Promo CD:** Around **3.55% APY** (with a minimum deposit, often $5,000).
    * **12-Month Promo CD:** Around **3.50% APY** (with a minimum deposit).
    * **36-Month Promo CD:** Around **3.00% APY** (with a minimum deposit).
* **Standard CDs** typically have very low interest rates, often around **0.01% APY**, regardless of the term length or deposit amount.

**Important Considerations:**
* **Rates Change:** Interest rates are subject to change, so it's always best to check Fifth Third's official website or contact them directly for the most current and specific rates for your location and account type.
* **Promotional Offers:** Keep an eye out for promotional offers, especially for Money Market accounts and CDs, as these often provide the most competitive rates from Fifth Third.
* **Minimum Balances and Fees:** Be aware of any minimum balance requirements to earn interest or to waive monthly service fees, as these vary by account.
