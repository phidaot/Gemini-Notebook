Yes, you can withdraw from your Lake Michigan Credit Union (LMCU) certificate, but it's important to be aware that doing so before the maturity date will likely result in an early withdrawal penalty.

A certificate of deposit (CD) is designed as a "set-it-and-forget-it" investment where your funds are deposited for a fixed length of time. LMCU states that early withdrawals are subject to a significant interest penalty.

If you need to access your funds, you should contact LMCU directly to discuss your specific certificate and the potential penalties. You can reach their Member Services Department at (800) 242-9790 or visit a local branch.
