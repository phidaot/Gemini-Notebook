While it's technically possible to transfer a house title yourself, especially in a simple situation like a gift between family members, it's generally highly recommended to go through a title agency or at least consult with a real estate attorney.
Here's why and what a title agency does:
Why a Title Agency is Recommended (and often required):
 * Title Search: This is one of their most crucial functions. They'll research public records to ensure the property's title is clear and free of any issues like:
   * Unpaid taxes
   * Liens (e.g., from contractors, creditors)
   * Easements (rights for others to use a part of the property)
   * Legal disputes or judgments
   * Previous mortgages
   * Errors in past deeds
   * This protects you as the buyer from inheriting someone else's problems.
 * Title Insurance: After the title search, they typically issue title insurance. This insurance protects both the buyer (owner's policy) and the lender (lender's policy, if there's a mortgage) from financial loss if a title issue arises after the purchase that wasn't discovered during the search.
 * Escrow Services: Title companies often act as escrow agents. They hold funds (like your down payment) and documents securely until all conditions of the sale are met. This ensures that money isn't disbursed until all legal requirements are fulfilled.
 * Closing Agent: They facilitate the closing process, ensuring all necessary documents are signed correctly, notarized, and that funds are properly distributed according to the purchase agreement.
 * Recording the Deed: After closing, they'll handle the official recording of the new deed with the county's Register of Deeds office (in your area, Kent County, Michigan, for example), which officially transfers ownership and makes it public record.
 * Expertise in Local Laws: Real estate laws vary by state and even county. A title agency has the expertise to navigate these complexities and ensure everything is done legally and correctly for your specific location (like Kentwood, Michigan).
What Happens if You Don't Use a Title Agency:
If you decide to handle the transfer yourself, you would need to:
 * Conduct a thorough title search: This can be complex and time-consuming, requiring you to access public records and understand how to interpret them.
 * Draft the deed: You'd need to prepare the legal document that officially transfers ownership. There are different types of deeds (e.g., general warranty, quitclaim), and choosing the right one is important.
 * Ensure proper signing and notarization: The deed must be signed by the grantor (seller/giver) and notarized to be valid.
 * Record the deed: You would be responsible for filing the deed with the county Register of Deeds office.
 * Address any potential issues: If any liens or claims against the property are discovered, you would need to resolve them yourself.
Important Note for Michigan:
In Michigan, when a property transfer occurs, the new owner must file an affidavit with the local assessor within 45 days. This can "uncap" the property's taxable value, meaning your property taxes could increase significantly in the year following the transfer. Certain transfers, such as those to a spouse, parent, sibling, or child, may be exempt from this uncapping if the property is not used for commercial purposes. A title agency or attorney would guide you through these specific Michigan requirements.
In summary: While not always legally required for every type of transfer (especially simple ones), using a title agency or a real estate attorney is highly advisable for the protection and peace of mind they offer in ensuring a smooth, legal, and secure property transfer. If you're involved in a transaction with a mortgage, the lender will almost certainly require the use of a title company.
