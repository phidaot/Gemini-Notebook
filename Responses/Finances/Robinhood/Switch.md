Based on information available from Robinhood, to switch from a monthly to a yearly Robinhood Gold plan, you will need to cancel your current monthly subscription and then sign up for the annual plan.

Here's the general process:

1.  **Cancel your current monthly subscription.** You can usually find this option in your account settings under the Robinhood Gold section.
2.  **Wait for the current billing cycle to end.** Even after canceling, you will still have access to your Gold benefits until the end of your billing period.
3.  **Resubscribe to Robinhood Gold with the annual plan.** Once your monthly plan has fully expired, you should have the option to choose the annual subscription.
