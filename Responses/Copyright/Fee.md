That's an excellent follow-up question. The barrier to copyright is actually quite low. In the U.S., copyright protection is **automatic** the moment an original work of authorship is "fixed in a tangible medium of expression." This means as soon as you write, draw, or record something, it's technically protected. You don't have to do anything to get that basic level of protection.

However, while you have an automatic copyright, there are significant benefits to formally registering your work with the U.S. Copyright Office. This is where fees come in.

### The Barrier to Registration (and the Fees)

There is a fee to register your work, but it's not a legal requirement to have copyright. The registration process is what gives you a much stronger legal standing if you ever need to enforce your rights.

The fees for copyright registration are not prohibitively expensive and vary depending on the type of application you file. For a single work created by a single author (who is also the claimant), the electronic filing fee is generally around **$45**.

If you're a bit more complex, like a standard application with multiple authors or a work made for hire, the fee is a bit higher, typically **$65** for an electronic filing. The fees for a paper application are higher. There are also specific fees for things like group registrations (for multiple works like a series of photographs or a collection of unpublished works) and for "special handling" if you need the registration processed quickly due to a pending legal issue.

### Why Register?

Even though you have an automatic copyright, here's why you'd want to pay the fee and register:

* **Ability to Sue:** For U.S. works, you must register your copyright (or have been refused a registration) before you can sue someone for infringement in federal court.
* **Statutory Damages and Attorney's Fees:** If you register your work in a timely manner (before the infringement or within three months of publication), you can be awarded "statutory damages" and attorney's fees in a successful lawsuit. Without registration, you can only sue for "actual damages" (how much you lost) and profits the infringer made, which can be much harder to prove.
* **Public Record:** Registration creates a public record of your copyright claim, which can be helpful as evidence of ownership.

So, to summarize, the barrier to copyright itself is lowâ€”it's automatic and free. The barrier to getting the full legal benefits of a registered copyright involves a relatively small fee and a formal application process.
