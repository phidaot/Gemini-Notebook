A character must be sufficiently **original and creative** to be eligible for copyright protection. It can't be a generic archetype, but it also doesn't need to be entirely unique in every aspect. The character must be a "story being" with a distinct personality, appearance, and characteristics, rather than a mere stock character.

### The "Story Being" Test

To be copyrighted, a character generally needs to be more than just a name or a general concept. The character should be a "story being" with a well-developed personality, a clear physical description, and specific traits that are integral to their identity. For example, a character who is simply a "detective" would not be copyrightable, as this is a common archetype. However, a detective with a specific backstory, a unique and detailed appearance, a peculiar personality, and specific methods for solving crimes could be copyrightable.

The more detailed and distinct a character is, the stronger the case for copyright protection. The character must be an expressive creation, not just a utilitarian one. This is why characters like **James Bond**, **Sherlock Holmes**, and **Harry Potter** are protected by copyright. They are not just generic spies, detectives, or wizards; they are fully developed individuals with unique traits and stories.

### Exceptions and Limitations

While a character must be original, it's important to remember that the **idea of a character cannot be copyrighted**, only the specific expression of that idea. This is the **idea-expression dichotomy**. For example, you can't copyright the idea of a superhero, but you can copyright the specific expression of a superhero like **Superman** with his specific powers, costume, and origin story.

Also, the level of detail required can vary depending on the jurisdiction. The **U.S. Copyright Office** and courts have a history of analyzing characters based on their "story being" quality. Other countries have similar standards, focusing on whether the character is a substantial and distinct creation. A character's visual design, such as their costume or a distinct physical feature, can also be a key factor in establishing copyrightability.
