A suffix is a letter or group of letters added to the **end** of a word to form a new word or to change the word's grammatical function.

For example:
* Adding "-ing" to "walk" gives you "walking."
* Adding "-tion" to "act" gives you "action."
* Adding "-ly" to "quick" gives you "quickly."

Is there a specific word or type of suffix you're thinking about?
