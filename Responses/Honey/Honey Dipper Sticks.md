Honey dipper sticks, often just called honey dippers, are small kitchen tools designed specifically for serving honey. Their unique design is what makes them so effective. Instead of a solid spoon, they have a series of concentric grooves at the end.

When you dip a honey dipper into honey and lift it out, the honey gets trapped in these grooves. By slowly rotating the stick, you can keep the honey from dripping as you transfer it from the jar to your toast, tea, or whatever you're drizzling it on. Once you stop rotating, the honey flows cleanly off the end.

They're usually made of wood, often bamboo or olive wood, but you can also find them in metal or plastic.
