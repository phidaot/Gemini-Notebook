You're right, some free QR code generators use redirects or add ads, which can be frustrating. The key to avoiding this is understanding the difference between **static** and **dynamic** QR codes.

* **Static QR codes** directly embed the information (like a URL) into the QR code itself. Once generated, they cannot be changed, but they don't rely on any third-party service for redirection. This means no ads or intermediate pages.
* **Dynamic QR codes** point to a short URL managed by the QR code generator. This allows you to change the destination URL later without creating a new QR code, and often provides analytics. However, this also means you're dependent on their service, and they may introduce ads or charge for features.

To create QR codes for free without ads or redirects, you'll want to focus on static QR code generators. Here are some good options:

1.  **Your Web Browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.):** Many modern web browsers have a built-in QR code generator.
    * Go to the webpage you want to create a QR code for.
    * Look for a "Share" icon (often an arrow pointing up, or a square with an arrow pointing out) or a QR code icon in the address bar.
    * Click on it, and you should see an option to "Create QR code" or similar.
    * This generates a static QR code that links directly to the page.

2.  **Adobe Express Free QR Code Generator:** This is a good online option that offers customization and doesn't expire. It allows you to input a URL, text, or other content and generate a high-quality QR code.
    * It's free and states that QR codes won't expire.
    * You can customize the style and color.
    * You can download the QR code in PNG, JPEG, or PDF.

3.  **QRStuff:** This generator explicitly states that it doesn't force you to use their URL shortener and offers 100% ad-free QR codes, even for free users.
    * It supports various data types beyond just URLs.
    * You can download in PNG, SVG, or PDF formats.
    * Static QR codes are permanent and don't expire.

4.  **QRCode Monkey:** This is another popular free option for creating custom QR codes with logos and design options.
    * It allows for high-resolution downloads suitable for print.
    * Generated QR codes are static and don't expire.
    * It's free for commercial usage.

5.  **QR Creator:** This generator also emphasizes being free indefinitely, without registration, no expiration, and no scan limits for normal use.
    * It offers design customization.
    * You can download in vector data like SVG.

**Important considerations:**

* **Static vs. Dynamic:** If you need the ability to change the destination of your QR code later, you'll have to use a dynamic QR code service, which may come with limitations or fees. For direct, permanent links, static is the way to go.
* **Testing:** Always test your QR code after you create it to ensure it scans correctly and goes to the intended destination.
* **Resolution:** If you plan to print your QR code, make sure to download it in a high-resolution format (like SVG or PDF) so it doesn't pixelate when scaled.
* **Quiet Zone:** Ensure there's enough clear space around the QR code when you place it on a design or print it. This "quiet zone" helps scanners read the code properly.

By choosing a static QR code generator, you can avoid the redirects and ads often associated with free services.
