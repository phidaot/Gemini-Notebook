It's smart to be cautious when a stranger asks for your WhatsApp number. Here's a breakdown of the risks and what to be aware of:

### The Risk: Your Phone Number is Your WhatsApp Identity

The core of the issue is that your WhatsApp account is directly tied to your phone number. Unlike some other messaging apps, you can't register with an email or a username alone. This means:

* **They will have your real phone number.** There's no way around it. If you give them your WhatsApp number, it is your actual phone number.
* **They can try to use it for other purposes.** A scammer or malicious person might use your number to try to find you on other social media platforms, or to send you spam and phishing messages via regular text or calls.

### What They Can See on WhatsApp

While they will have your phone number, you have some control over what else they can see. By default, WhatsApp can show a non-contact these things:

* Your profile photo
* Your "About" status (the short text description)
* Your "Last Seen" and "Online" status

The risk is that they can use this information to build a more complete profile of you, which could then be used for more targeted social engineering attacks. For instance, if your profile photo shows your children, they could potentially use that to craft a more personal and manipulative scam.

### How to Protect Yourself

If you choose to give a stranger your WhatsApp number, you can significantly mitigate the risks by adjusting your privacy settings. You can set them to only share information with people in your contacts list.

To do this, go to:
**WhatsApp Settings > Privacy**

You can change the following to `My Contacts` or `Nobody`:

* **Last seen & online:** Hides when you were last active and if you're currently online.
* **Profile photo:** Hides your profile picture from non-contacts.
* **About:** Hides your bio/status text.
* **Groups:** This is a crucial one. You can prevent strangers from being able to add you to group chats without your permission.
* **Status:** Hides your status updates.

Given that you are a parent with two young children, it is especially important to be mindful of who you share personal information with, even seemingly harmless details like a profile photo. Taking these steps can help protect not only your own privacy but also that of your family.
