Google Voice and WhatsApp both offer free calls and messages, but they are fundamentally different services with distinct purposes and features.

Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

### Google Voice

* **Service Type:** Google Voice is a VoIP (Voice over IP) service that provides you with a **real, cloud-based phone number**. This number is not tied to a specific device or SIM card.
* **Purpose:** It's primarily a call and text management tool. It's great for getting a "secondary" or "burner" number, consolidating multiple phone lines, or managing a separate number for a business.
* **Core Features:**
    * **Call and Text:** You can make and receive calls and send SMS messages to regular phone numbers in the U.S. and Canada for free.
    * **Call Forwarding:** A key feature is the ability to forward your Google Voice number to multiple phones (your cell phone, your home phone, your work phone, etc.). All of them will ring when someone calls your Google Voice number.
    * **Voicemail Transcription:** It automatically transcribes voicemails to text, which is a very useful feature.
    * **Spam Filtering:** It uses Google's AI to filter out spam calls and texts.
    * **Web Access:** You can use it from any web browser on your computer.

### WhatsApp

* **Service Type:** WhatsApp is an **instant messaging app**. It uses your phone number only as a unique identifier for your account, not as a traditional phone number that can be used for calls to and from regular phone numbers.
* **Purpose:** It's designed for private, instant communication with other WhatsApp users. It has become a global standard for communicating with friends and family, especially internationally.
* **Core Features:**
    * **User-to-User Communication:** All communication (calls and messages) must be with other people who also have a WhatsApp account. You can't use it to call a landline or text someone who doesn't have the app.
    * **End-to-End Encryption:** All messages and calls are encrypted by default, meaning only the sender and receiver can access the content. This is a major security and privacy advantage.
    * **Rich Messaging:** It's built for sharing a variety of media, including photos, videos, voice messages, stickers, and documents.
    * **Group Chats:** WhatsApp is well-known for its robust group chat functionality, making it easy to communicate with a large group of people at once.
    * **Status Updates:** It includes a social media-like "Status" feature.
