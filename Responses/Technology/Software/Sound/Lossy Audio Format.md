A **lossy audio format** is a type of compression that removes some of the original audio data to significantly reduce the file size. This process is irreversible, and the discarded information is typically data that is considered inaudible or less important to the human ear.

### How Lossy Compression Works

Lossy compression uses psychoacoustic models to analyze the audio and identify parts of the sound that a human listener is unlikely to perceive. This includes:

* **Masking:** A loud sound can "mask" or hide a quieter sound that occurs at a similar frequency. Lossy codecs will remove the quieter, masked sound.
* **Frequency Limits:** Humans can only hear sounds within a certain frequency range. Frequencies outside of this range are often discarded.

The result is a much smaller file, but with some loss in fidelity compared to the original uncompressed audio.

### Common Examples

Some of the most popular lossy audio formats include:

* **MP3 (MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3):** One of the oldest and most widely used lossy formats.
* **AAC (Advanced Audio Coding):** Often considered more efficient than MP3, offering better quality at the same bitrate. It's used by platforms like Apple Music and YouTube.
* **Ogg Vorbis:** An open-source, patent-free alternative to formats like MP3.
* **WMA (Windows Media Audio):** Developed by Microsoft, it's often used within the Windows ecosystem.

These formats are ideal for streaming, portable devices, and situations where storage space is limited, as the small file size allows for faster downloads and more files to be stored.
