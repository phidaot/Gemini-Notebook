OGG, or **Ogg Vorbis**, is a free and open-source audio compression format. It's often compared to MP3, but there are a few key differences.

Think of it like this: A digital music file is like a recording of a song. To make the file smaller, a compression format like Ogg Vorbis or MP3 is used. This process removes some of the audio data that the human ear is less likely to notice, resulting in a smaller file size.

### Key Characteristics of Ogg Vorbis

* **Open and Free:** Unlike some other formats, Ogg Vorbis is not restricted by patents. This means anyone can use it without paying licensing fees.
* **Variable Bitrate:** Ogg Vorbis files are typically encoded with a variable bitrate, which means the amount of data used per second can change throughout the song. This is more efficient than a constant bitrate, as it uses more data for complex parts of the music and less for simpler parts, resulting in a smaller file size without sacrificing quality.
* **Quality:** At a given bitrate, Ogg Vorbis is generally considered to have better audio quality than MP3.

While MP3 is still the most common audio format, Ogg Vorbis is widely used in gaming, and many music streaming services use it. You may have also encountered Ogg Vorbis files if you've done any modding for a game or downloaded a free sound effect online.
