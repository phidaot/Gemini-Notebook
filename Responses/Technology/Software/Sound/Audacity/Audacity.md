Audacity is a very popular, free, and open-source digital audio editor and recording software. It's available for multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Here are some of its key features and uses:

* **Audio Recording and Editing:** You can record live audio from a microphone or mix sounds together from different sources. It's a multi-track editor, which means you can work with several audio files at once.
* **Effects and Processing:** Audacity offers a wide range of built-in effects like noise reduction, normalization (to make the volume consistent), fading, and pitch adjustment. It also supports various plugins to expand its capabilities.
* **Import/Export and Conversion:** It can import and export many common audio formats like WAV, AIFF, MP3, and Ogg Vorbis. With a separate FFmpeg library download, you can also handle formats like M4A (AAC) and WMA.
* **Use Cases:** It's often used for things like creating podcasts, digitizing old records or tapes, editing music, and creating sound effects.

You mentioned you use a Windows 11 Pro desktop, so Audacity would work well for you. It's a great tool for anyone looking to get started with audio editing without a cost.
