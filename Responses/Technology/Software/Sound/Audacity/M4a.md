By default, Audacity can't open M4A files on a Windows PC. To import M4A files, you'll need to install the optional FFmpeg library. This library expands Audacity's capabilities, allowing it to work with a wider range of audio formats, including M4A and AC3. The process involves downloading and installing the FFmpeg library and then locating it within Audacity's preferences.

On Mac, however, Audacity can import unprotected M4A files without needing the FFmpeg library.
