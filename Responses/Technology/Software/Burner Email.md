A "burner email" is a temporary, disposable email address that you can use to protect your primary email from spam, marketing lists, or potential security breaches. There are a couple of different approaches to this, each with its own advantages.

### 1. Temporary/Disposable Email Services

These are often free services that give you a temporary email address for a short period of time, like a few minutes or a few hours. They are great for one-time use, like signing up for a free trial or a website where you just need to confirm an email address and have no intention of using the account again.

* **10 Minute Mail:** As the name suggests, this service gives you an email address that self-destructs after 10 minutes. It's a no-frills, hassle-free option.
* **Guerrilla Mail:** This service provides a temporary address and allows you to send emails from it, which is a feature not all temporary services offer. It's good for quick, anonymous communication.
* **Temp Mail:** A very popular option that provides a temporary, secure, and anonymous email address. You just visit the site and get an address instantly.

**Pros:**
* Extremely easy to use, no registration required.
* Completely anonymous.
* Great for avoiding spam on a one-off basis.

**Cons:**
* The email addresses are often public or expire quickly, so they are not suitable for accounts you need to access again.
* Some websites and services have lists of domains from these services and will block them.

### 2. Email Aliasing/Forwarding Services

This is a more robust and long-term solution. These services create unique, temporary email addresses that forward messages to your real email inbox. You can manage these aliases, turn them off, or delete them if they start receiving spam. This is a great option for situations where you might need to receive emails from a service again in the future, like for a newsletter you want to read or a shopping account.

* **SimpleLogin:** This is a service that allows you to create multiple aliases that forward to your real inbox. It offers browser extensions and mobile apps to make it easy to generate new aliases on the fly.
* **DuckDuckGo Email Protection:** A free service that creates a unique `@duck.com` email address for you, which forwards to your primary email. It also strips out email trackers before they reach your inbox.
* **Burner Mail:** Similar to SimpleLogin, this service creates unique email addresses for every site you sign up for. It also has a browser extension and allows you to block senders and reply to emails directly from the burner address.

**Pros:**
* Offers more control and a longer lifespan.
* Your real email address is never exposed.
* You can manage and disable aliases if they become compromised.

**Cons:**
* Often requires a free or paid account to use.
* Can be more complex to set up than a simple temporary email service.

Given your use of tools like Notion and Dropbox Paper, you might appreciate the long-term organization and control that an email aliasing service provides. You could create unique aliases for different services (e.g., `trelloservice@youralias.com`) and manage them all from a central location. This would provide more security and control than a one-time-use temporary email.
