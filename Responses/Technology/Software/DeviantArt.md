Yes, DeviantArt does allow for videos, in addition to images.

While it is widely known as a platform for images, it has a "film category" that was added in 2007. The platform supports a variety of video file types, including AVI, MP4, MOV, and others.

However, there are some restrictions and conditions for video uploads:
* Video uploads are exclusively for Core Members (a paid subscription service).
* There are limits on file size and length, which vary depending on the specific Core Membership tier.
* The video content must adhere to DeviantArt's content policies, which prohibit certain types of graphic or inappropriate material.
