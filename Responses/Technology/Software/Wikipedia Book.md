Yes, you can export sections of a Wikipedia page as a PDF, but not directly through a built-in "select and export" function. Instead, you would use a different method to create a custom PDF.

Here are a couple of ways you can do it:

* **Create a Book (Recommended for multiple articles or sections):** Wikipedia has a "Book creator" tool that lets you compile multiple articles—or even specific sections—into a single PDF. This is a great way to combine information from different parts of Wikipedia into one organized document.
    1.  On any Wikipedia page, look for the **"Print/export"** section on the left sidebar.
    2.  Click **"Create a book"**.
    3.  A "Book creator" bar will appear at the top of the page. You can then add the current page and other pages to your book.
    4.  Once you've added all the content you want, you can rearrange it, add chapters, and then download it as a PDF. This method is particularly useful if you're researching a topic and want to gather information from various related articles, much like how you might gather information about Final Fantasy games from their respective pages.

* **Print to PDF (for a single section):** While this won't be a native Wikipedia PDF, you can use your browser's print function to save a specific part of a page.
    1.  Highlight the section you want to save.
    2.  Right-click the highlighted text and select **"Print"** or press **Ctrl + P** (on Windows).
    3.  In the print dialog box, change the destination to **"Save as PDF"** or **"Microsoft Print to PDF."**
    4.  You can also adjust the "Pages" setting to only print the pages that contain your selected text, which helps to isolate the section you want. This is a quick and easy method for capturing a small, specific part of an article.
