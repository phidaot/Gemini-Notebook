Unlike other PC launchers like Steam, the Epic Games Launcher doesn't have a built-in screenshot feature. However, you can still take screenshots on your Windows 11 Pro desktop or laptop using several methods:

**1. The Windows + Print Screen Shortcut**

This is the most direct and widely used method. It captures your entire screen and saves the image to a specific folder on your computer.

* Press the **Windows key** + **PrtScn** (Print Screen) key on your keyboard at the same time.
* Your screen may dim for a moment, indicating that the screenshot was taken.
* The screenshot is saved automatically to the **Screenshots** folder, which is located inside your **Pictures** folder. You can find it by navigating to: `C:\Users\[Your Username]\Pictures\Screenshots`.

**2. The Xbox Game Bar Overlay**

Since you're using a Windows PC, you can use the Xbox Game Bar to capture your screen.

* Press the **Windows key** + **G** to open the Xbox Game Bar.
* In the "Capture" widget, click the camera icon to take a screenshot.
* The screenshot will be saved in your Videos/Captures folder by default, but you can change the save location in the Game Bar settings.

**3. Using a Third-Party Tool**

Since your desktop has a GeForce RTX 5060 graphics card, you can use the NVIDIA GeForce Experience overlay.

* By default, the shortcut to open the overlay is **Alt + Z**. You can change this in the settings.
* Once the overlay is open, you can find the screenshot button or use the default shortcut, which is typically **Alt + F1**.
* The screenshots will be saved in the GeForce Experience gallery, which you can access through the overlay.
