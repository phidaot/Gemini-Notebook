Of course. What you're describing is a rapidly growing category of software, often called an **AI Meeting Assistant** or **Real-time Intelligence Platform**. These tools listen to conversations, transcribe them in real-time, and then use AI to extract key information, define terms, and provide context.

Given your work in a technical field using tools like C\#, Visual Studio, and TeamCity, you're likely in meetings filled with specific jargon, project names, and acronyms. A tool like this could be incredibly valuable for onboarding, or when talking with different teams or clients.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the leading options that do what you're asking for:

### Top Tools for Real-Time Transcription and Context

| Tool | Key Features | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365** | - Integrates directly into Teams meetings.\<br\>- Real-time transcription.\<br\>- You can ask Copilot questions during the meeting like, "What does the acronym 'TFS' mean?" or "Summarize the last 5 minutes."\<br\>- Generates meeting notes, action items, and summaries post-meeting. | Users heavily invested in the Microsoft ecosystem (Windows, Office, Teams). Given you use Windows 11 Pro, this is a very natural fit. |
| **Gemini for Google Workspace** | - Integrates directly into Google Meet.\<br\>- Live transcription with speaker labels.\<br\>- Provides real-time summaries and context within the meeting.\<br\>- "Take notes for me" feature and post-meeting summaries. | Users heavily invested in the Google ecosystem. Since you use a Pixel phone and several Google productivity tools, this is another excellent option to explore. |
| **Otter.ai** | - Real-time transcription with highlights.\<br\>- Automatically identifies keywords, jargon, and custom vocabulary.\<br\>- **Otter AI Chat** lets you ask questions about the meeting content in real-time or after.\<br\>- Can automatically join Zoom, Meet, and Teams meetings as an attendee. | A platform-agnostic solution that works across different conferencing tools and is one of the most mature products in this space. |
| **Fathom** | - Records, transcribes, and summarizes meetings.\<br\>- Provides real-time transcription.\<br\>- Generates summaries and syncs action items to task managers like Trello (which you use).\<br\>- Offers a very generous free tier. | Individuals or teams looking for a powerful, free, and easy-to-use meeting assistant that integrates with other productivity tools. |

### How The Technology Works

The functionality you're describing is a combination of several AI technologies working in sequence, all in a matter of seconds:

1.  **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: The system first captures the audio from the meeting and converts it into written text. The accuracy and speed of this step are critical.

2.  **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: The transcribed text is then fed into an NLP engine. This is where the "understanding" happens.

3.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: This is the specific NLP task that identifies and categorizes key information in text. It's trained to spot things like:

      * **People**: "Let's check with Sarah on that."
      * **Organizations**: "We need to get approval from a stakeholder at GitLab."
      * **Products**: "This will be deployed using TeamCity."
      * **Jargon/Acronyms**: "What's the status on the PR for the new API endpoint?"

4.  **Contextual Lookup**: Once an entity is identified, the system queries a knowledge base to provide the definition or context. This knowledge base could be:

      * A public one like Wikipedia.
      * The Large Language Model's own internal data.
      * A private, company-specific glossary you can build over time.

5.  **User Interface (UI)**: The information is then presented to you in a non-intrusive way, often in a sidebar or as a tooltip you can hover over.

This entire process can be visualized like this:
$$\text{Spoken Words} \rightarrow \text{STT Engine} \rightarrow \text{Live Transcript} \rightarrow \text{NLP (with NER)} \rightarrow \text{Knowledge Base} \rightarrow \text{Context Displayed in UI}$$

### Recommendation

Based on your tech stack and existing tools:

  * If your workplace uses **Microsoft Teams**, exploring **Microsoft Copilot** is your most integrated and powerful option. It's built for the environment you're already in.
  * If your team prefers **Google Meet**, then **Gemini for Google Workspace** is the equivalent and would be the best choice, especially since you already use other Google services.
  * If you want a solution that works across any platform or if your company doesn't provide the top-tier licenses for Teams/Meet, **Otter.ai** or **Fathom** are fantastic third-party choices.
