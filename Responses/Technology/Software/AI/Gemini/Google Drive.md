No, Gemini cannot directly access Google Drive files with public links. The ability for Gemini to interact with your Google Drive content is a specific feature within Google Workspace and requires you to have an eligible plan and to explicitly enable the Google Workspace extension for Gemini.

### How Gemini Works with Google Drive

This functionality is designed to be privacy-preserving. Gemini only accesses content that you have personally given it access to. This means it can summarize documents, find files, or synthesize information across multiple files in your Drive, but only within the context of your own account and with your permission. It does not have the ability to go out and "crawl" public links on the internet to find and process files.

For Gemini to work with your files, you need to enable the Google Workspace extension and then use prompts that reference the files or folders you want it to interact with. For instance, you could use a prompt like "Summarize the key points in @Sales Team Meeting Notes" to have it summarize a specific document in your Drive.
