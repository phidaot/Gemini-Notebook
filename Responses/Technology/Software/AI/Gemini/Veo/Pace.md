That's a common issue with current generative video models. They often default to a slower, more deliberate pace unless you're very specific and descriptive about the energy and rhythm. Your prompt has the right technical details, but it's missing the *performance* and *action* words to guide the AI.

The model is probably interpreting "rap a song" as "speak these words" and ignoring the BPM because the lyrics are too short to establish a rhythm.

Here are a few revised prompts. I would start with the first one, as it's the most descriptive.

### Option 1: The Descriptive Prompt (Recommended)

This version turns your list of attributes into a cohesive scene description, which models often interpret better. It focuses on describing the *energy* and *action*.

```
A high-energy, acapella rap performance. A close-up shot of a person rapping with their eyes closed. The style is confident and sharp, like a K-pop idol performing the rap part of a song, similar to "Takedown" by TWICE. The vocal delivery is fast, rhythmic, and percussive, maintaining a driving pace of 140 BPM.

Audio is acapella voice only. No subtitles.

Lyrics: "It's a takedown, I'mma take you out. You'll break down like, 'What?'"
```

### Option 2: The Direct & Punchy Prompt

This one is a bit more direct, front-loading the most important commands like "fast-paced" and "140 BPM."

```
fast-paced 140 BPM acapella rap, in the K-pop style of TWICE's song "Takedown". A person with their eyes closed raps directly to the camera with swagger and a confident attitude. The vocal flow is rhythmic and clear. Voice only, no music, no subtitles.

Lyrics: It's a takedown, I'mma take you out. You'll break down like, "What?"
```

### Why These Prompts Should Work Better:

  * **Action Words:** I've added words like "high-energy," "fast-paced," "confident," "swagger," "rhythmic," and "percussive." These tell the AI *how* to perform the rap, not just that it *should* be a rap.
  * **Reinforcing BPM:** By saying both "140 BPM" and "fast-paced," "driving pace," we're emphasizing the speed you want.
  * **Style Nuance:** Specifying "K-pop idol performing the rap part" is more descriptive than just the song title. It gives the AI a character archetype to work from.
  * **Scene Context:** Framing it as a "performance" or giving a camera angle ("close-up shot") helps the model build a more dynamic and intentional scene.

Give these a try. You may need to generate a few times, as AI video can be inconsistent, but these prompts should get you much closer to the result you're looking for.
