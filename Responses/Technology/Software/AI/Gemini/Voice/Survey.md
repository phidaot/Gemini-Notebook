* **Dipper:** Often described as warm, easy-going, and natural-sounding. One user even likened it to an "awkward nerd."
* **Pegasus:** This voice is frequently mentioned for its natural intonation and breathing, with one user noting it sounds like a character from the movie *Interstellar*.
* **Capella:** Praised for sounding less impatient or irritated than some of the other voices, and for having a Northern English accent.
* **Orbit:** Described as "chill," "classy," and having a laid-back attitude, with a voice some compared to Miles Morales.
