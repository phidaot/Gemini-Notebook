Yes, Gemini can access GitHub repositories, but it requires a specific process and has some limitations. You can import a public or private GitHub repository into the Gemini web app to ask questions about the codebase, get help with debugging, and receive suggestions for improvements.

### How to Import a GitHub Repository

To import a repository, you must be signed in to the Gemini web app on a computer. You'll use the "Add file" or "Import code" option in the text box and provide the GitHub repository's URL. For private repositories, you'll need to link your GitHub account to your Google Account. It's important to know that after you import a repository, Gemini doesn't sync with any future changes to it.

### What Gemini Can and Can't Do

With the GitHub app, you can ask Gemini to help you better understand the code, answer questions about specific functions, and even suggest code additions. However, Gemini **cannot** retrieve commit history, pull requests, or other metadata. It also **cannot** write to the code repository itself. There are also file and size limits for each repository you import (up to 5,000 files and a maximum size of 100 MB).
