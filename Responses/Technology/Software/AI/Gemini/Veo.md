Veo is Google DeepMind's generative AI model for creating videos. Announced in May 2024, it can generate high-quality, cinematic videos from text and image prompts.

Key features of Veo include:

* **Native Audio Generation:** In addition to video, Veo can generate synchronized audio, including sound effects, ambient noise, and even dialogue, to create a more complete and immersive experience.
* **Physics Simulation:** The model is designed to reflect real-world physics, resulting in more natural-looking motion and visuals in the generated videos.
* **Multi-Modal Input:** You can use both text descriptions and image references to guide the video creation process.
* **Different Versions:** Similar to the Gemini models, there are different versions of Veo. For example, **Veo 3 Fast** is a newer, more optimized version for speed and cost-effectiveness, which is useful for developers and high-volume tasks.

Veo is also being integrated into the Gemini chatbot, which means you can use a single prompt to describe the video you want to create and then watch it come to life.
