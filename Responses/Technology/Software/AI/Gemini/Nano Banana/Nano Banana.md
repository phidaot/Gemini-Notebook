That's a great question! "Nano banana" is a term that has recently emerged, but it's not a type of fruit you would find in the produce aisle. Instead, it's the internal codename for a new AI image editing model from Google.

Here's what you need to know about Nano Banana:

* **It's an AI model:** The official name for the technology is Gemini 2.5 Flash Image. It's a powerful tool that allows you to edit and generate images using simple text prompts.
* **Key Features:** Nano Banana is being praised for its ability to maintain consistency. For example, if you upload a photo of a person or pet and ask the AI to change their clothes or put them in a different setting, it's designed to keep the subject's likeness consistent across the edits. This is a significant improvement over previous AI models.
* **How it's used:** You can use the Nano Banana model through the Gemini app. You simply upload a photo and describe what you want to change, like "Put my son Levi in a superhero costume," or "Change the background of this photo of Evalynn to a fantastical forest." The model can also blend multiple photos, apply different artistic styles, and make step-by-step edits.
* **Availability:** This feature is being rolled out to Gemini users and is also available to developers through Google AI Studio and Vertex AI platforms.

The name "Nano Banana" is a bit of a whimsical codename, in keeping with Google's history of using fruit names for internal projects. It's a fun and memorable way to refer to this new technology.
