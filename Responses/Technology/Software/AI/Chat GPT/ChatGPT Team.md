ChatGPT Team is a self-serve subscription plan from OpenAI designed for organizations and businesses. It's a step up from the individual ChatGPT Plus plan and is meant for collaborative use.

### Key Features and Details:

* **Pricing:**
    * $30 per user per month (billed monthly).
    * $25 per user per month (billed annually).
    * It requires a minimum of two users.
    * Your data is not used to train OpenAI's models, and you own your inputs and outputs. The data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

* **Included Capabilities:**

* **ChatGPT Team vs. ChatGPT Enterprise:**
    * **ChatGPT Team** is a great option for small to mid-sized teams (2 or more users) who want a straightforward, self-service solution for collaboration. It provides a secure environment and essential features without the complexity of a larger enterprise rollout.
    * **ChatGPT Enterprise** is for larger organizations (typically with a minimum of 150 users) that need a more comprehensive solution. It includes everything in the Team plan, plus features like single sign-on (SSO), domain verification, usage analytics, priority support, and a larger context window. The pricing for Enterprise is custom and requires contacting OpenAI's sales team.
