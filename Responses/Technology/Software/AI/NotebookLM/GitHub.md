NotebookLM does **not** have a direct, native integration for connecting to or referencing a GitHub repository as a source. You cannot simply paste a GitHub URL and have it ingest all the files, like you can with a Google Doc or a YouTube video.

### Supported Sources

The application primarily supports the following source types:
* PDFs and other text-based files (.txt, .md).
* Google Docs and Google Slides.
* Public web pages and URLs.
* YouTube video transcripts.
* Audio files.
* Copied and pasted text.

To reference content from a GitHub repository, you would need to use a workaround by treating the repository's files as individual sources.

### Workarounds

Here are a few ways you could get content from a GitHub repository into NotebookLM:
* **Use the URL option:** You can copy the URL for a specific file, like a `README.md` or a `.py` file, and add it as a source. However, this will only import the content of that single file, not the entire repository. This is similar to how you use GitKraken to view and manage individual files within a repository.
* **Copy and paste:** For smaller code snippets or documentation, you could copy the text directly from the GitHub page and paste it into NotebookLM as a new source.
* **Download and upload:** You could download the relevant files from the repository to your local machine and then upload them individually to your NotebookLM notebook.

Third-party developers have also created tools and workarounds to facilitate this process, but they are not official features of NotebookLM. These tools, sometimes referred to as "RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) tools," are designed to pull information from a repository and format it in a way that is compatible with AI assistants like NotebookLM.
