Currently, NotebookLM doesn't have a direct, built-in integration with Zoho Sheets. NotebookLM is primarily designed to work with sources like PDFs, Google Docs, Google Slides, and YouTube videos. However, you can still get your data from a Zoho Sheet into NotebookLM by exporting the sheet as a **PDF** or a similar text-based file format and then uploading it as a source.

### Using a Third-Party Integration Tool
While a direct integration isn't available, you could potentially use a third-party service like **Zoho Flow** to create an automated workflow that connects Zoho Sheet and Zoho Notebook, a different product from Zoho, which might then be used to get information into NotebookLM. However, this is a more complex workaround and requires setting up a separate system.

This video provides an example of how a third-party connector can be used to link two different spreadsheet services, which is similar to the kind of automation that might be explored to get data from Zoho into another application.
