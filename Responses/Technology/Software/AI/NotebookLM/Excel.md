You're correct, NotebookLM doesn't have a direct, native integration with Excel. It can't directly read a `.xlsx` file.

However, you can still use your Excel data in NotebookLM. The most effective way is to **export the data from Excel into a compatible file type** and then upload that file as a source. The supported formats include **PDF**, **TXT**, and **Markdown**.

### How to Use Excel Data in NotebookLM

1.  **Export as PDF**: This is often the best option as it preserves the formatting of your spreadsheet, which can make it easier for the AI to understand the structure of the data, like column headers and rows. To do this, in Excel, go to **File** -> **Save As** and select **PDF** from the dropdown menu.
2.  **Export as Text or CSV**: If the data is simple and doesn't require complex formatting, saving it as a plain text file (.txt) or a Comma Separated Values (.csv) file can also work. This is a good option for large datasets where you only need the raw numbers and text for analysis.
3.  **Copy and Paste**: You can also simply copy a range of cells from your spreadsheet and paste them directly into a new source in NotebookLM. This is a quick method for smaller, specific data sets.

By using these methods, you can leverage NotebookLM's AI capabilities to analyze, summarize, and ask questions about your Excel data.
