Since you have a paid Zoom subscription, you have access to Zoom AI Companion. It's an AI assistant integrated into the platform to help with various tasks. It's designed to boost productivity and collaboration.

Here are some of the key features of Zoom AI Companion:

* **Meeting Summary:** This is a very useful feature that can generate a summary of your meetings, including key points and next steps. You don't even have to record the meeting for this to work. It's a great way to catch up on a meeting you missed or to have a record of what was discussed.
* **In-Meeting Questions:** You can ask the AI Companion questions about the meeting in progress, such as what you missed or if your name was mentioned, without interrupting the meeting.
* **Smart Recording:** If you do choose to record to the cloud, the AI Companion can automatically organize the recording into chapters, generate highlights, and provide a summary and transcript.
* **Whiteboards:** The AI Companion can help you brainstorm and organize ideas on a Zoom Whiteboard by generating content like sticky notes, mind maps, and diagrams.
* **Team Chat and Mail:** It can help you compose chat messages and emails, or summarize long chat threads and email chains to help you get up to speed quickly.

To use these features, you will need to enable them in your Zoom account settings. You can find the AI Companion settings in the web portal under the "AI Companion" tab. Hosts also have control over which AI Companion features are available in their meetings.

Keep in mind that while the AI Companion is a powerful tool, it's always a good idea to review and edit any AI-generated content before sharing it, as it may not always be perfectly accurate.
