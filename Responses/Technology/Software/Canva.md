Canva is a popular, user-friendly graphic design platform that allows you to create a wide range of visual content. It's known for its drag-and-drop interface, which makes it accessible for people without professional design experience.

Here are some of the key things you can do with it:

* **Create various types of content:** You can design everything from social media posts, invitations, and posters to presentations, websites, and even t-shirts.
* **Use templates:** Canva has a vast library of customizable templates, stock photos, fonts, and other design elements that you can use as a starting point.
* **Collaborate:** It's a great tool for teams, as you can work together on a design in real time. This could be useful if you're working on something for your family or a group project.
* **AI tools:** Canva has been integrating AI features to help with things like generating images from text, removing backgrounds from photos, and resizing designs with a single click (some of these are part of their paid plans).
* **Print services:** You can also design and order physical products directly through the platform, like business cards or mugs.

Canva offers a free version with a lot of functionality, as well as a paid "Pro" version that gives you access to more premium features, templates, and storage. Given your interest in tools like Whimsical and Notion, which are also collaborative and visually oriented, Canva might be a good fit for creating visual content for personal or project-based use.
