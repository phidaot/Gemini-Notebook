Yes, absolutely. DaVinci Resolve is perfectly suited for those tasks.

* **Cutting out frames/editing:** This is a fundamental part of the editing process. You can easily cut, trim, and rearrange clips on the timeline. If you have an animation, you can cut out specific frames or sections to tighten up the timing or remove unwanted parts.
* **Speeding up parts of your animation:** You can definitely adjust the speed of clips in DaVinci Resolve. The software provides powerful tools for "time remapping," allowing you to change the speed of a specific section of a clip, speed up or slow down the entire clip, and even create smooth speed ramps. This is an excellent way to create dynamic and punchy sequences in your animation.

Given your experience with games that have a lot of particle effects and kiting, like *Vampire Survivors*, using speed ramps and editing to create a sense of frantic or fast-paced action could be a fun way to apply your editing skills.
