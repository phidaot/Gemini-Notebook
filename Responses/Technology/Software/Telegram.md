Telegram is a popular, cloud-based instant messaging and social media service. It's a cross-platform app, meaning you can use it on your phone, tablet, and computer, and all your chats are synced across your devices.

### Key Features

* **Cloud-Based Storage:** Unlike some other apps that store messages locally on your device, Telegram stores all your chats and media in its cloud. This allows you to access your entire chat history from any device without needing to back it up or transfer it.
* **Large Group Chats and Channels:** Telegram is known for its ability to handle massive communities. You can create groups with up to 200,000 members and channels with an unlimited number of subscribers for broadcasting messages.
* **Large File Sharing:** You can send very large files, up to 2 GB each, which is a significant advantage over many other messaging apps.
* **Customization and Bots:** Telegram has a wide range of customization options for themes and the user interface. It also has a powerful and open API that allows developers to create "bots"â€”small programs that can perform various tasks within the app, from getting news updates to managing payments.

### Privacy and Security

Telegram has a strong reputation for privacy, but it's important to understand the nuances of its security model, especially when compared to an app like WhatsApp.

* **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** By default, Telegram's regular chats are *not* end-to-end encrypted. They are encrypted between your device and Telegram's servers, and then encrypted again from the servers to the recipient's device. This is called client-server encryption.
* **"Secret Chats":** For truly private conversations, Telegram offers a separate feature called "Secret Chats." These are end-to-end encrypted, meaning only the sender and recipient can read the messages. These chats are also device-specific and do not sync to the cloud. You have to manually start a Secret Chat.
* **Privacy Settings:** Telegram provides extensive privacy settings, allowing you to control who can see your phone number, profile photo, and "Last Seen" status. You can also set messages to self-destruct after a certain period of time.

In contrast to your experience with WhatsApp, Telegram allows you to be contacted by a username, which can help you avoid giving out your real phone number. However, you still need a phone number to create an account, which is a common practice to prevent spammers.
