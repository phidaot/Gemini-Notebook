The **Clone Tool** in GIMP is a fundamental tool for copying and duplicating parts of an image. It works by taking pixels from a selected source area and "painting" them onto a target area. This is useful for removing objects, repairing blemishes, or creating patterns.

### How it Works
The Clone Tool is a very direct and manual process. Unlike the Heal Tool, it doesn't try to blend or intelligently match the surrounding texture or lighting; it simply duplicates the pixels from the source. This gives you precise control over what is being copied. It's often used for tasks that require a perfect copy of a texture, like extending a brick wall or cloning a cloud to fill a gap in the sky.

### Using the Clone Tool in GIMP
1.  Select the **Clone Tool** from the toolbox. It looks like a rubber stamp.
2.  Adjust the brush size and hardness in the tool options to fit your needs.
3.  Hold down the `Ctrl` key and click on the area you want to use as your **source**. This sets the starting point for your cloning.
4.  Release the `Ctrl` key.
5.  Click and paint over the area you want to **clone to**. As you paint, the tool will copy the pixels from the source area and apply them to the target area.
