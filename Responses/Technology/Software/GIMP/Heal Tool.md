The **Heal Tool** in GIMP is used for retouching and removing blemishes or unwanted objects from an image. It works by taking a sample of pixels from a source area and using them to intelligently blend and "heal" a target area.

### How it Works

The Heal Tool differs from the Clone Tool because it doesn't just copy pixels directly. Instead, it analyzes the texture, lighting, and shading of the surrounding area of the target and blends the sampled pixels to create a seamless repair. This makes it particularly effective for removing things like pimples, wrinkles, or small objects on textured backgrounds.

### Using the Heal Tool in GIMP

1.  Select the **Heal Tool** from the toolbox.
2.  Hold down the `Ctrl` key and click on a clean area of your image that you want to use as the **source**.
3.  Release the `Ctrl` key.
4.  Click and paint over the area you want to **heal**. GIMP will use the sampled pixels to fix the target area.
