Parsec is a remote desktop application that specializes in high-performance video streaming, primarily for gaming. It allows you to run a game (or any application) on one computer and play or use it remotely from another device, with a focus on low latency and high fidelity.

Here's a breakdown of what Parsec offers:

* **Remote Gaming:** This is its main selling point. Parsec is designed to deliver a smooth 60 FPS (up to 240 FPS for some users) at up to 4K resolution, with minimal input lag, making it feel like you're playing directly on the host machine. Given your interest in games like Kingdom Hearts 2, Megaman X, and your enjoyment of bullet hell games like Vampire Survivors, Parsec could be a way to enjoy those on different devices.
* **Low-Latency Desktop Sharing:** While gaming is its primary focus, Parsec is also an excellent tool for general remote desktop access. It's often praised for its responsiveness, making it suitable for creative professionals, developers, and anyone who needs to access a powerful workstation remotely.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Parsec clients are available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. This means you could potentially stream from your PC (which has an RTX 5060, a great card for gaming!) to your Google Pixel 9a phone with your Razer Kishi v3 controller for on-the-go gaming, provided you have a good network connection.
* **Collaboration Features:** Parsec allows for instant collaboration by sharing sessions. This means you can play local multiplayer games with friends remotely, or even work together on projects by sharing your screen.
* **Features for Professionals (Parsec Warp and Teams):**
    * **Parsec Warp** offers enhanced features like multi-monitor support, 4:4:4 color mode for improved visual accuracy, virtual displays, and full pressure/tilt support for drawing tablets.
    * **Parsec for Teams** provides additional administrative tools, granular permissions, SSO (Single Sign-On) support, and more, making it suitable for larger organizations and distributed teams.
* **Security:** Parsec emphasizes security with peer-to-peer connections (meaning your data doesn't pass through Parsec's infrastructure), multi-factor authentication (MFA), and options for controlling which applications guests can see and interact with.

**How it works (in a nutshell):**

You install Parsec on your "host" computer (the powerful machine where the game or application is running) and on your "client" device (the device you want to stream to). Once you log in, you can connect to your host machine and stream its display and input to your client device.

It's a popular choice for gamers and professionals alike who need to access their powerful machines remotely with minimal compromise in performance.

### Linux

Yes, Parsec is available for Linux, but with a significant caveat: **you can only use it as a client to connect to other devices, not as a host to stream *from* a Linux machine.**

This means you can install Parsec on your Linux computer (specifically, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is explicitly supported, though other distros might work with workarounds) and then connect to your Windows PC (where you have your RTX 5060) to stream games or applications.

So, while you can use your Linux device to **play** games streamed from your Windows PC, you cannot use a Linux machine as the primary computer that is doing the "hosting" (the one running the game/application) for others to connect to via Parsec.
