Truth Social is a social media platform launched in 2022 by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), which is majority-owned by President Donald Trump. It was created primarily in response to Trump being banned from mainstream social media platforms.

Here's a breakdown of Truth Social:

**Purpose and Features:**
* **"Big Tent" for Free Speech:** Truth Social is promoted as a "Big Tent" social media service that advocates for free speech, aiming to provide a platform for open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating against political ideology.
* **Twitter-like Interface:** The platform is closely modeled on Twitter (now X). Users can create profiles, follow others, post messages called "Truths" (similar to tweets), and share other users' posts ("ReTruths," similar to retweets). It includes features like direct messaging, photo/video sharing, and the ability to join groups based on common interests.
* **Content Moderation:** While promoting free speech, Truth Social does have terms of service and encourages users to block or mute content they don't want to see. Content that violates its terms of service can be removed. Initially, it faced issues with Google Play for not removing posts inciting violence, but was approved after implementing stronger moderation policies.
* **Built on Mastodon:** Truth Social uses a customized version of Mastodon, a free and open-source social network hosting software, as its backend.

**Ownership and Leadership:**
* Truth Social is owned by Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG).
* Donald Trump is the founder and majority shareholder of TMTG.
* Devin Nunes is the CEO.

**User Base and Demographics:**
* As of January 2025, Truth Social had an estimated 6.3 million monthly active users.
* The platform's user base is predominantly conservative, with a high percentage of accounts expressing right-leaning or pro-Trump sentiments.
* A significant portion of its users are from the United States (around 84%).
* Surveys indicate that a large percentage of Democrat voters and women are not interested in using the platform.

**Controversies:**
* **Censorship Allegations:** Despite promoting free speech, reports have emerged of Truth Social shadowbanning liberal and progressive users, as well as certain conservative content.
* **Financial and Regulatory Issues:** Since mid-2022, Truth Social has faced financial and regulatory challenges.
* **Software Licensing:** There were initial concerns about Truth Social violating Mastodon's AGPLv3 license by not offering its source code to users, which was later resolved.
* **National Security Concerns:** Donald Trump's use of Truth Social to post in real-time while in office has raised concerns about potential national security implications, such as revealing sensitive operations.
* **Technical Glitches:** The platform has experienced technical issues, including crashes due to high traffic during public feuds.
