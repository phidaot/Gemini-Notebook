It's true, *Infinity Nikki* is surprisingly polished for a free-to-play game. If you're looking for other visually impressive free games to push your new desktop's RTX 5060, there are a few standouts. Many of these games have a "live-service" model, with developers constantly updating them, which means they often have the latest graphical improvements.

Here are some of the best-looking free-to-play games:

* **The Finals:** This is a first-person shooter known for its stunning visuals and a high degree of environmental destruction. It runs on Unreal Engine 5, which allows for incredibly detailed graphics and realistic lighting. The fast-paced, destructive gameplay makes it a great way to show off your new GPU.

* **Genshin Impact / Honkai: Star Rail:** Since you've enjoyed *Final Fantasy* games and have a love for collectible-driven games, these two from HoYoverse are worth checking out. They both have a beautiful, vibrant anime art style and an expansive open world. *Genshin Impact* is a more action RPG-focused experience, while *Honkai: Star Rail* is a turn-based RPG, but both feature top-tier graphics, especially on PC.

* **Destiny 2:** Bungie's sci-fi looter-shooter has been around for a while, but it continues to receive graphical updates. The game's intricate alien worlds, stunning skyboxes, and detailed armor and weapon designs are a visual treat. It's a great choice if you enjoy beautiful, cinematic experiences.

* **Warframe:** This sci-fi action game has a very unique and stylistic look, with highly detailed character and enemy models. The combat is fast, fluid, and filled with particle effects, which you appreciate in games like *Vampire Survivors*. The developers have consistently updated the game's engine and graphics over the years.

* **Fortnite:** It might seem like an obvious choice, but *Fortnite* has undergone significant graphical improvements over the years, also having made the jump to Unreal Engine 5. With its highly stylized visuals and new features like global illumination and ray-traced reflections, it can look surprisingly good on a high-end PC.

These games are all available on the platforms you own (PC and PlayStation 5) and are known for pushing the boundaries of what free-to-play titles can look like.
