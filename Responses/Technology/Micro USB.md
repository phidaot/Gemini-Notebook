Micro USB is a small, rectangular connector that was widely used for charging and data transfer in many electronic devices for over a decade. Before USB-C became the dominant standard, you'd find Micro USB ports on a vast array of gadgets.
Common uses and applications for Micro USB include:
 * Charging devices: It was the standard for charging most Android phones, tablets, and portable electronics.
 * Data transfer: Used to move photos, videos, and other files between devices like phones, cameras, and computers.
 * Connecting accessories: Many Bluetooth speakers, wireless headphones, power banks, digital cameras, and even some game controllers still use Micro USB.
 * Smart home devices: You might find Micro USB ports on smart plugs, LED lighting controllers, and indoor temperature sensors.
Micro USB vs. USB-C:
While Micro USB is still present in many older or budget-friendly devices, USB-C is the newer and more advanced standard. Here's a quick comparison:
 * Shape: Micro USB has a distinct trapezoidal shape, meaning you have to insert it in the correct orientation. USB-C has a symmetrical, oval shape, allowing for reversible insertion (no more fumbling to plug it in!).
 * Data Transfer Speed: Micro USB generally supports slower data transfer speeds (up to 480 Mbps for USB 2.0, or up to 5 Gbps if it supports USB 3.0). USB-C supports much faster speeds, including USB 3.1, USB 3.2, and USB 4.0, which can go up to 40 Gbps.
 * Power Delivery: Micro USB typically provides up to 9 Watts of power, suitable for smaller devices. USB-C can deliver significantly more power, ranging from 15 to 100 Watts or even higher, making it capable of charging laptops and other larger devices.
 * Versatility: USB-C is more versatile, supporting various functions like video output (DisplayPort, HDMI) and even acting as a host for other USB peripherals (like connecting a mouse or keyboard to a phone).
While USB-C is becoming the new standard for many devices, Micro USB cables and devices are still very common and widely available due to their widespread adoption in the past.
