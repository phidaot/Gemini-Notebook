You're looking to convert Markdown content to MediaWiki format, or perhaps use Markdown directly within MediaWiki. Given that your team uses MediaWiki version 1.42.3 and GitLab, here's a breakdown of your options:

**1. Converting Markdown to MediaWiki Wikitext**

The most common and reliable way to convert existing Markdown files to MediaWiki's native wikitext format is to use a universal document converter like **Pandoc**.

  * **How it works:** Pandoc is a command-line tool that can read various markup formats (including Markdown) and write them into other formats (including MediaWiki wikitext).
  * **Command example:**
    ```bash
    pandoc -f markdown -t mediawiki your_file.md -o your_file.wiki
    ```
      * `-f markdown`: Specifies the input format as Markdown.
      * `-t mediawiki`: Specifies the output format as MediaWiki wikitext.
      * `your_file.md`: Your input Markdown file.
      * `your_file.wiki`: The output MediaWiki wikitext file. You would then copy and paste the content of this `.wiki` file into a MediaWiki page.
  * **Online Converters:** There are also online tools that use Pandoc or similar engines to convert Markdown to MediaWiki, which can be useful for quick conversions without installing software.

**Considerations for Conversion:**

  * **Syntax Differences:** While both Markdown and MediaWiki Markup are plain text markup languages, their syntax for certain elements can differ. Pandoc does a good job, but you might need to manually review and adjust some formatting, especially for complex tables, code blocks, or specific linking conventions.
  * **Extensions:** If your MediaWiki instance uses specific extensions that add custom wikitext features, Pandoc might not convert to those exact syntaxes.

**2. Using Markdown Directly in MediaWiki (via Extensions)**

If you prefer to write new content in Markdown directly within MediaWiki, you'll need a MediaWiki extension that enables Markdown parsing. This can be very convenient if your team is already comfortable with Markdown from using GitLab.

  * **Extension: WikiMarkdown:** This seems to be the most actively maintained and robust option.

      * **Features:** It allows you to use `<markdown>` tags within your wiki pages to embed Markdown content. It also functions as a content handler for pages ending in `.md`, meaning those pages will be entirely interpreted as Markdown. It integrates with CodeEditor for Markdown syntax highlighting and with SyntaxHighlight for code blocks within Markdown.
      * **Installation:** You'd typically download the extension, place it in your `extensions/` folder, and add `wfLoadExtension( 'WikiMarkdown' );` to your `LocalSettings.php` file. It also requires Composer to install its PHP dependencies (like Parsedown).
      * **Compatibility:** It's compatible with MediaWiki 1.35+. Since your team uses MediaWiki 1.42.3, this should work well.

  * **Older Extensions:**

      * **Extension:Markdown:** This extension is listed as "unmaintained" and was last updated in 2014. While it might still work, it's not recommended for new installations due to lack of support and potential compatibility issues with newer MediaWiki versions.

**Recommendation:**

For migrating existing Markdown content, **Pandoc** is your go-to for conversion. For ongoing use of Markdown for new content within your MediaWiki, installing the **WikiMarkdown extension** would provide a much smoother workflow for your team.

Given your team's use of GitLab, which heavily relies on Markdown, adopting a MediaWiki extension for Markdown support could significantly improve your team's efficiency and consistency across platforms.
