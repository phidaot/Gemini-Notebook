DeepSeek is a Chinese artificial intelligence company that has gained significant attention for its development of large language models (LLMs) at a reported fraction of the cost of its Western competitors like OpenAI and Google.

Here's a summary of key information about DeepSeek:

**Company Background:**
* **Founded:** May 2023 in Hangzhou, China.
* **Founder & CEO:** Liang Wenfeng, who is also the co-founder of the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer. DeepSeek is owned and funded by High-Flyer.
* **Focus:** Developing large language models (LLMs), with an emphasis on research and open-source principles (though their models are "open weight" meaning parameters are shared, with some usage conditions).
* **Strategy:** They focus on research and don't have immediate commercialization plans, which also helps them navigate certain Chinese AI regulations. They prioritize skills over long work experience in hiring, including recruiting individuals from diverse academic backgrounds (e.g., poetry, advanced mathematics) to broaden their models' knowledge.

**Key Technologies and Products:**
* **DeepSeek-V3:** Their general-purpose chatbot assistant, designed to compete with models like ChatGPT-4o. It was trained at a significantly lower cost compared to some other leading models. It excels in both English and Chinese, and performs well in coding and math tasks.
* **DeepSeek-R1:** A "reasoning" model designed for step-by-step logical deduction and complex problem-solving. It's known for its efficiency and ability to show its "thought process" before providing an answer.
* **DeepSeek Coder:** A variant specifically designed for programming tasks, trained on a large dataset of code.
* **Janus Pro:** A multimodal AI model specializing in image generation and visual analysis, comparable to models like DALL-E 3.
* **Innovations:** DeepSeek has pioneered techniques like Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency, extra-long context windows (up to 128,000 tokens), and optimized training methods that reduce energy consumption and data requirements.

**Impact and Controversies:**
* **Cost-Efficiency:** DeepSeek's ability to develop high-performing AI models at a fraction of the usual cost has been a major disruptor in the AI industry, challenging the notion that advanced AI requires massive financial resources.
* **Open-Source Approach:** Making their models freely available for commercial use under the MIT License has fostered broader adoption and innovation.
* **Performance:** Their models have shown strong performance in benchmarks, sometimes matching or exceeding established models from US companies.
* **Data Privacy Concerns:** A German data protection watchdog has raised concerns about DeepSeek's app allegedly transmitting German user data to China, where it could be accessed by Chinese authorities. This has led to requests for Apple and Google to block the app in their app stores.
* **Censorship:** DeepSeek's chatbot has been noted to self-censor on politically sensitive topics in China.

DeepSeek's emergence has been described as "upending AI" due to its innovative approaches to developing powerful AI models more efficiently and making them openly accessible.
