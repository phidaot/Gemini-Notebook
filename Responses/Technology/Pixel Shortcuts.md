Of course! You've already found some of the most essential ones. The Pixel phones are full of these convenient shortcuts and gestures. Here are several others you should know about, organized by category:

### Physical Gestures (Tapping & Moving Your Phone)

These are some of the most useful "magic" tricks your Pixel can do. You can manage most of them in `Settings > System > Gestures`.

* **Quick Tap to start actions:** This is a big one. You can double-tap the back of your phone to perform an action. It's customizable!
    * **How:** Go to `Settings > System > Gestures > Quick Tap`.
    * **What it can do:** You can set it to take a screenshot, open a specific app (like PokÃ©mon Go or Master Duel for quick access), toggle the flashlight, show notifications, and more.
* **Flip to Shhh:** Perfect for meetings or when you need quiet time. Placing your phone face down on a flat surface will automatically turn on Do Not Disturb.
    * **How:** Enable it in `Settings > System > Gestures > Flip to Shhh`.
* **Flip camera for selfie:** When you're in the Camera app, you can quickly switch between the rear and front-facing cameras by twisting your wrist twice.
    * **How:** Enable it in `Settings > System > Gestures > Flip camera for selfie`.
* **Lift to check phone:** Simply lift your phone to wake the screen and see the time and your notifications on the lock screen without pressing any buttons.
    * **How:** Enable it in `Settings > Display > Lock screen`.

### On-Screen & Navigation Shortcuts

* **Quickly Switch Between Your Last Two Apps:** This is a must-know for multitasking. Just swipe right along the very bottom navigation bar (the little pill-shaped line). Swiping left and right will scroll through all your recent apps.
* **Access One-Handed Mode:** If you find the screen too big to reach with one thumb, you can swipe down on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. This will bring the entire screen down into easy reach.
    * **How:** Enable it in `Settings > System > Gestures > One-handed mode`. This can be very handy when you've got your hands full with your kids, Levi and Evalynn.
* **Quickly Access Quick Settings:** Instead of swiping down once for notifications and a second time for the full Quick Settings panel, just swipe down from the top of the screen with **two fingers** to open it immediately.
* **Select Text or Images from the App Overview:** When you swipe up to see your recent apps, you can tap and hold on any text or image directly from the app preview to copy, share, or save it without even opening the app fully.

### Camera & Audio Shortcuts

* **Use Volume Keys as a Shutter:** When the Camera app is open, you can press either volume button to take a photo. This often helps you take a steadier shot than tapping the screen.
* **Activate Live Caption:** When any media is playing, press a volume button. In the volume slider that appears on-screen, tap the little icon that looks like a speech bubble. This will provide real-time captions for almost any audio playing on your phone, which is great for watching videos quietly or in a noisy place.

Given that you enjoy mobile games, you might also find the **Game Dashboard** useful. When you're in a game, a small controller icon might appear on the side. Tapping it gives you quick access to tools for screen recording, taking screenshots, seeing an FPS counter, and enabling a "Do Not Disturb" mode specifically for your game so you aren't interrupted. You can manage its settings in `Settings > Google > Game Dashboard`.
