To connect your JC200 controller to your Nintendo Switch, follow these steps:
 * On your Nintendo Switch:
   * Go to the HOME Menu.
   * Select "Controllers."
   * Then select "Change Grip/Order."
 * On the JC200 controller:
   * Hold down the Home button on the controller for about 3 seconds until the lights start flashing. This puts the controller into pairing mode.
 * Complete the connection:
   * Your Switch should detect the JC200 controller. Once it appears on the screen, press the "A" button on the controller to confirm the connection.
If you have any trouble, sometimes restarting the process or making sure the controller is charged can help.
