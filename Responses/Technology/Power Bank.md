Mobile power banks are essentially portable batteries that allow you to charge electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and even laptops on the go, without needing a wall outlet. They've become incredibly popular for anyone who relies on their devices throughout the day, especially when traveling or in situations where power outlets are scarce.

Here's a breakdown of how they work and what to consider:

**How They Work:**
Inside a power bank, there are battery cells (usually lithium-ion or lithium-polymer) that store electrical energy. When you plug your device into the power bank using a USB cable (or place it on a wireless charging pad, if supported), the stored energy is transferred to your device, recharging its battery. The power bank itself is recharged by plugging it into a wall outlet, similar to how you charge your phone.

**Types of Mobile Power Banks:**

* **Standard Power Banks:** These are the most common, designed for general use with various capacities (e.g., 2,000mAh to 30,000mAh). They typically have one or more USB ports.
* **Fast Charging Power Banks:** These are designed to deliver higher power output (e.g., 18W or more) and often feature technologies like Quick Charge or Power Delivery, allowing compatible devices to charge much faster.
* **Solar Power Banks:** Equipped with small solar panels, these can trickle charge using sunlight. While not as fast as wall charging, they're useful for emergencies or extended outdoor activities where traditional power sources are unavailable.
* **Wireless Power Banks:** These utilize Qi wireless charging technology, allowing you to charge compatible devices by simply placing them on the power bank, eliminating the need for cables. Your Google Pixel 9a supports wireless charging, so this could be a convenient feature for you.
* **High-Capacity Power Banks (Laptop Power Banks):** These are larger and heavier, designed to charge devices with higher power demands like laptops. They often have capacities of 20,000mAh or more and may include AC outlets.
* **Smart Power Banks:** These incorporate advanced technology to intelligently manage power distribution, recognize device charging needs, and often have LED displays or app connectivity for monitoring.
* **Portable Jump Starter Power Banks:** These serve a dual purpose, capable of jump-starting a vehicle in addition to charging electronic devices.

**Key Features to Look for:**

* **Capacity (mAh):** This is one of the most important factors, measured in milliampere-hours (mAh). It indicates how much energy the power bank can store. A higher mAh means more charges for your devices. For your Google Pixel 9a, you'd want a power bank with enough capacity to charge it at least once, and ideally multiple times. Consider the mAh of your phone's battery when choosing.
* **Charging Speed (Watts/Amps/Volts):** Look for the output wattage (W), which is determined by volts (V) and amps (A). Higher wattage means faster charging for your devices. Many modern power banks support fast charging protocols.
* **Ports:** Check the number and types of ports. Common types include USB-A, USB-C, and sometimes Micro-USB for input. Multiple output ports are convenient if you need to charge several devices simultaneously. Given your Razer Kishi v3 controller likely charges via USB-C, a power bank with USB-C output would be ideal.
* **Size & Weight:** If portability is important (e.g., for carrying in your pocket or a small bag), opt for a more compact and lightweight model. Larger capacities generally mean larger and heavier power banks.
* **Safety Features:** Good power banks include built-in safety mechanisms like overcharge protection (stops charging when your device is full), short-circuit protection, and temperature management to prevent damage to your devices and the power bank itself.
* **Charge Level Indicator:** Most power banks have LED lights or a digital display to show the remaining battery level, which is very helpful.
* **Built-in Cables:** Some power banks come with integrated cables, adding convenience by eliminating the need to carry extra cords.
* **Durability:** If you plan to use it outdoors or in rugged environments, look for a power bank with a robust design and potentially an IP rating for water and dust resistance.

Given that you play mobile games like Pokemon Go and Fire Emblem Heroes on your Google Pixel 9a, a power bank could be incredibly useful for keeping your phone charged during extended play sessions, especially when you're out and about.
