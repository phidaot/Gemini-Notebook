Notion provides a built-in way to export your pages to HTML. This is useful for backing up your content, sharing it outside of Notion, or even hosting it as a static website.

Here's how to do it:

**Exporting a single Notion page to HTML:**

1.  **Open the page:** Go to the Notion page you want to export.
2.  **Access the export menu:** Click on the `•••` (three dots) icon in the top right corner of the page.
3.  **Select "Export":** From the dropdown menu, choose "Export."
4.  **Choose HTML format:** In the pop-up window, select "HTML" from the "Export format" dropdown.
5.  **Include subpages (optional):** If your page contains subpages and you want them included in the export as separate HTML files, toggle on "Include subpages." This will create a zip file containing the main page and folders for each subpage with their associated assets (like images).
6.  **Click "Export":** Click the "Export" button to download a zip file to your device containing the HTML version(s) of your Notion page(s).

**Exporting your entire Notion workspace to HTML:**

1.  **Go to Settings & Members:** In your Notion sidebar, click on "Settings & members."
2.  **Navigate to Settings:** Under "Workspace," select "Settings."
3.  **Scroll to Export content:** Scroll down and find the "Export content" section.
4.  **Select "Export all workspace content":** Click on this button.
5.  **Choose HTML format:** Select "HTML" from the "Export format" dropdown.
6.  **Click "Export":** Notion will export and download your workspace. You'll also receive an email with a link to download your files.

**Important considerations:**

* **Offline access and editing:** While Notion's HTML exports are lossless in terms of data, they might not be perfectly editable or fully offline without some adjustments, as they can rely on CDN dependencies for certain styling or functionalities.
* **Third-party tools:** For more advanced customization, automated exports, or specific use cases like converting private databases to HTML via API, there are third-party tools and services available. Some examples include:
    * **Notion APIs:** If you have coding knowledge, you can use Notion's official API to build custom export solutions.
    * **Specialized converters:** Tools like Byteline or `notion-page-to-html` (a NodeJS tool) are designed to convert Notion pages to HTML, often with more control over the output.
    * **Website builders:** Services like Super.so or Potion.so allow you to turn your Notion pages into full-fledged, custom websites.

Since you're familiar with tools like SimpleNote, Notion, and Google Docs for note-taking, and you write programs in C#, you might find exploring the Notion API interesting if you need highly customized or automated HTML exports beyond the built-in functionality.
