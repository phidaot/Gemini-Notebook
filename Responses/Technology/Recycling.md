#### Recommendation

For your old routers and modems, **Best Buy's recycling program is a very practical and beneficial choice, especially if you are looking to purchase a new device**, as the 15% discount is a nice perk.

However, if you are not in the market for a new router and simply want to ensure your old devices are handled with the highest environmental and data security standards, a **certified local e-waste recycler like Comprenew is an outstanding option.** Supporting a local non-profit that is a certified e-Stewards recycler provides a high level of assurance.

**Before you recycle any router or modem, it is crucial to perform a factory reset.** This will wipe your personal settings, including your Wi-Fi network name and password, and any other sensitive information stored on the device. You can typically do this by pressing and holding a small, recessed button on the back of the device for 10-30 seconds.
