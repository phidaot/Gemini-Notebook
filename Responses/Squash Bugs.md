Squash bugs ($Anasa$ $tristis$) are a common garden pest that primarily feeds on plants in the gourd family, particularly squash and pumpkins. They are often mistaken for stink bugs because they can emit a foul odor when crushed.

### Identification
* **Adults:** They are flat-backed, grayish-brown insects, about 5/8 inch long.
* **Nymphs:** Young nymphs have light green bodies with black legs and heads. As they mature, their bodies become a grayish-white color.
* **Eggs:** The eggs are small, oval, and a shiny bronze to reddish-brown color. They are typically laid in clusters on the underside of plant leaves.

### Damage and Symptoms
Squash bugs feed by using their piercing, needle-like mouthparts to suck the sap out of leaves and stems. Their feeding can introduce a toxin into the plant, which can cause the leaves to turn yellow, wilt, and eventually turn brown and die. This is often referred to as "Anasa wilt." A severe infestation can kill young plants entirely and significantly reduce the yield of larger, more mature plants. They can also feed on the fruit, causing scarring and making it unmarketable.
