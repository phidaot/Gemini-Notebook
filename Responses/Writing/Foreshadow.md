Foreshadowing is a literary device used to hint at or suggest future events in a story. It's often used to create suspense, build tension, or add a sense of unease. There are several ways an author can foreshadow:

* **Dialogue:** A character might make a comment that seems insignificant at the time but later proves to be a clue about what's to come. For example, a character might say, "I have a bad feeling about this," just before they encounter a dangerous situation.
* **Symbolism:** An object, a color, or even an animal can represent a future event. A storm brewing in the distance, for instance, might foreshadow a conflict.
* **Setting:** The environment itself can hint at future events. A dark and stormy night might foreshadow a somber or frightening event, while a bright and sunny day might suggest a happy outcome.
* **Mood or Tone:** A shift in the story's mood can foreshadow a change in the plot. If a lighthearted scene suddenly becomes tense and serious, it could be a sign that something bad is about to happen.

A classic example is the presence of a gun in the first act of a play; if it's there, it will likely be used in the third act. The famous quote, "If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off," is often attributed to Anton Chekhov, and is known as Chekhov's Gun.
