Yes, Donald Trump has demonstrably distanced himself from Mike Pence, and vice versa, particularly following the events of January 6, 2021.

Here's a breakdown of their evolving relationship:

* **January 6th as a Turning Point:** The crucial moment of their divide came on January 6, 2021, when Pence, as Vice President, refused Trump's repeated demands to reject Electoral College votes during the certification of the 2020 election. Pence maintained that he did not have the constitutional authority to do so. This act, seen by many as upholding the Constitution, was directly contrary to Trump's wishes and led to public condemnation from Trump. Some Trump supporters at the Capitol even chanted "Hang Mike Pence!"

* **Public Criticism from Trump:** After January 6th, Trump has continued to express his grievances with Pence, publicly stating that Pence "couldn't cross the line of doing what was right" regarding the election. This criticism has been a recurring theme in Trump's public statements.

* **Pence's Response and Independent Path:**
    * Pence has clearly stated that he believes he upheld his oath to the Constitution on January 6th.
    * He has also become more willing to publicly criticize Trump, particularly regarding the events of January 6th and Trump's continued rhetoric about the 2020 election.
    * Pence launched his own bid for the 2024 presidential nomination, running against Trump, and explicitly stated that he could not endorse Trump's continued assertions about overturning the 2020 election. He later withdrew from the race.
    * Pence declined to endorse Trump in the 2024 election.
    * He has focused on promoting traditional conservative principles, often presenting a different vision for the Republican Party than Trump's populist approach.

In essence, while they served together for four years, the final days of their administration, particularly the events surrounding January 6th, created a significant and public rift that has persisted.
