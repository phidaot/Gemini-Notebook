BPM stands for "Beats Per Minute." It's a fundamental concept in music that measures the tempo or speed of a song. A higher BPM means the music is faster, while a lower BPM indicates a slower pace.

It's used by musicians, DJs, and music producers to:
* **Set the tempo for a song:** This provides a consistent pace for the entire band or composition.
* **Mix and match tracks:** DJs often need to match the BPM of different songs to create seamless transitions in a set.
* **Communicate tempo:** In sheet music, a metronome marking with a BPM number gives a precise instruction on how fast to play.

Beyond music, BPM can also refer to heart rate (beats per minute), which is the number of times a person's heart beats in one minute.
