A trap beat is a subgenre of hip-hop music characterized by its heavy use of synthesized drums, particularly the 808 bass kick, and complex hi-hat patterns. It's known for a sparse, minimalist feel that often creates a dark, ominous, or aggressive mood. The tempo is typically around 130-170 beats per minute, but the hi-hats often double or triple the tempo, giving it a much faster feel. The name "trap" comes from the slang term for a place where drugs are sold.
